introtext: "<p>\r\n\tHi *|FNAME|*,</p><p>\r\n\tanother week already passed! Yesterday Mark and I attended the Dutch MODX Meetup in&nbsp;Alkmaar. You can find a post about what happened&nbsp;<a href=\"https://modx.today/posts/2015/05/last-night-at-the-dutch-modx-meetup\">today on MODX.today</a> â€“ it was all about \"Workflow\". Take a look and hopefully you will learn something new or improve you workflow.</p><p>Improved was also the MODX Manager in the past. In our article&nbsp;\"The MODX Manager through the Years\" we collected screenshots from older version of MODX Revolution. Do you remember those times?</p><p>Enjoy your weekend!<br>Christian Seel</p>"
