introtext: '<p>Hi there!</p><p>In case you haven''t noticed yet, the week is almost over - it''s Friday!</p><p>This week we''ve published 4 posts on MODX.today to keep you up to speed on all things MODX. As you can see in the list below, we discussed 2 very different Extras, as well as&nbsp;a cool trick to comment out MODX code and today''s post on signs you''ve spent too much time working with MODX (including worrying more about your cache than what your significant other is doing with the joint credit card), so be sure to check those out.&nbsp;</p><p>We''ve already got some great content planned for the next few weeks varying from reviews of new/updated/underused&nbsp;extras and themes to a MODX history lesson and documentation-related tips. That said, we are still actively looking for guest authors to join our little editorial team! If you''re interested, please visit the&nbsp;<a href="https://modx.today/submit">Submit an Article</a> page on the website, or just hit reply to discuss some ideas.&nbsp;</p><p>If you''re worried you may have missed posts from earlier weeks, fear not, we now have a <em>Most Read </em>section which gives you&nbsp;<a href="https://modx.today/most-read">all of our 22&nbsp;published articles ordered by their popularity</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Have a great weekend!</p><p>Mark Hamstra</p>'
