introtext: '<p>Hi there!&nbsp;</p><p>It''s&nbsp;Friday, which means it''s time to get you up to speed on&nbsp;what''s been happening around the MODX world and on MODX.today.</p><p>Last week we grew the MODX.today team with a new recruit:&nbsp;<a href="https://modx.today/posts/2015/05/say-hello-to-release-robot-robbie" target="_blank">Release Robot Robbie</a>! He''s not a real human, but instead he chats up package providers to see if there are any new and exciting extras. Right now Robbie supports the MODX, modmore and Extras.io providers, and when there are updates he adds them to a weekly post on the site. This post will be updated throughout the week, with a new post published on Monday.&nbsp;<a href="https://modx.today/posts/2015/05/extra-updates-for-week-22" target="_blank">These were the extras released this week</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Just this morning, we published a post about&nbsp;MODX 3, which I''m sure a lot of people will find very interesting. It talks about the current status of that project, and what we know about. Hugo Peek also wrote about one of their projects to make TVs values on various input types&nbsp;easier to maintain.&nbsp;</p><p>As always you can find the full list of this weeks'' post below.&nbsp;</p><p>If you''re interested in becoming part of the MODX.today community&nbsp;of authors, we could use your help! All we ask is that you share your knowledge or interesting projects with the MODX community on MODX.today.&nbsp;We''ve simplified the process and guidelines, so&nbsp;<a href="https://modx.today/submit" target="_blank">submitting an article</a> is now easier than ever.&nbsp;</p><p>Have a great weekend, and see you in your inbox next week.</p><p>Mark Hamstra<br>Founder at modmore</p>'
