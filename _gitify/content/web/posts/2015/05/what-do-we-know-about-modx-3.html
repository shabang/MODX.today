        <p>Over the past few weeks, lead architect Jason "opengeek" Coward has been sharing his vision about the future of MODX on Medium.

If anything, MODX 3 is a long-term project that is just getting started.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Why do we need MODX 3 anyway?</h2>

<p>The current version of MODX serves a lot of people really well. It enables designers and front-end developers to build completely bespoke websites with minimal effort and core&nbsp;hacking unlike some of the competition. Even in the current iteration, building&nbsp;websites will be easy and completely feasible for many years to come. The very powerful templating language and elements, template variables and extensions like&nbsp;<a href="https://modmo.re/cb" target="_blank">ContentBlocks</a> are all ready for the future.&nbsp;</p><p>The biggest reason that we need a MODX 3 might just be that number. In order to clean up legacy code and to provide developers with better, industry-standard tools, MODX will need breaking changes. And as MODX follows&nbsp;<a href="http://semver.org/">semantic versioning</a>, that means the major version has to increase when that happens. MODX Revolution is version 2, so we need a version 3.&nbsp;</p><p>So why do we need breaking changes, if the current version of MODX is still very much relevant?

With the exception of the bump from Evo to Revo,&nbsp;MODX has been really stable and iterating progressively over the past decade, but at some point a breaking release needs to happen to iterate beyond what the current code allows.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Not Invented Here Syndrom</h2>

<p>In many ways, MODX was (unintentionally)&nbsp;built&nbsp;with the&nbsp;concept of <em style="background-color: initial;"><strong>Not Invented Here (NIH)</strong></em>, which is not a great design pattern.&nbsp;This basically means that where previously every part of the code&nbsp;was developed internally, in the future more standardised libraries developed by the wider community&nbsp;can be used. This shift has happened across the PHP community over the past few&nbsp;years thanks to&nbsp;<a href="http://getcomposer.org" target="_blank">Composer</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://packagist.org/" target="_blank">Packagist</a> making it extremely easy to use code from third parties and the rise of libraries that are exceptionally good at one, well-defined task.&nbsp;</p><p>By adopting these third party libraries, it is possible to develop solid applications quicker and&nbsp;better by taking advantage of fully unit tested code. Given how MODX currently doesn't really have any useful unit tests (<a href="https://github.com/modxcms/revolution/pull/12424" target="_blank">though there is movement</a>), this is a very big deal when it comes to an architecture and code quality perspective.&nbsp;</p><p>Some examples of places that were developed "in-house" before that we could&nbsp;see adopting outside libraries include the following:</p><ul>

<h2>What is Slim, and why use that?</h2>

<p><a href="https://medium.com/@drumshaman/keeping-modx-relevant-part-two-15a37eab5b48" target="_blank">In part two of the Keeping MODX Relevant series</a>, Jason mentioned&nbsp;<a href="http://www.slimframework.com/" target="_blank">Slim</a> (v3) as the likely candidate to be at the core of MODX. This has not gone unnoticed, with many people looking into Slim, wondering what it does, and how it will work.&nbsp;</p><p>Here's what you need to know about Slim:</p><ul>

<h2>What about the Manager and ExtJS?</h2>

<p>If you ask a random&nbsp;group of MODXers about their least favourite part of the system, it is quite likely ExtJS (or more generally "the manager") ranks incredibly&nbsp;high on that list.&nbsp;At this point there is not a defined direction for the manager that I know off, but sticking with ExtJS 3.4 is likely not going to happen. ExtJS 3 is very old, not very fast or mobile friendly,&nbsp;and it no longer receives updates as ExtJS 6 is already in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sencha.com/blog/announcing-ext-js-6-early-access-release/" target="_blank">early access</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>So while we don't know what the new manager will look like, or what it will be built with yet, we can be pretty confident it wont be ExtJS 3.&nbsp;</p><p>But what do we know?</p><p>Given Jason's choice for Slim as the core library to build on, his work on something called&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/opengeek/tacit" target="_blank">Tacit</a> ("<em>a high performance RESTful framework"</em>, coincidentally&nbsp;based on Slim)&nbsp;and some of the discussions on various IRC and&nbsp;<a href="[[~26]]" target="_blank">Slack</a>, it seems likely the next manager will see&nbsp;a RESTful API as base.&nbsp;The current manager also has an API, but its structure is not very standard, and&nbsp;somewhat geared&nbsp;towards what ExtJS expects from an API.&nbsp;It is definitely not RESTful.&nbsp;</p><p>By moving to a RESTful API as core service, the back-end and the actual interface will be further separated from a code perspective.

<h2>What's next?</h2>

<p>Right now, Jason is working on the highly anticipated part three of his series on the future of MODX. In that part, he'll share his vision on the subject of <em>persistence</em>&nbsp;- basically, interacting with the database. For the architecture of MODX this is a very important decision to make and Jason is spending time prototyping some&nbsp;possible solutions before publishing the results.</p><p>For now, the primary&nbsp;focus of MODX&nbsp;is on 2.3 and the upcoming 2.4.
