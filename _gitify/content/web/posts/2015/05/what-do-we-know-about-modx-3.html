        <p>Over the past few weeks, lead architect Jason "opengeek" Coward has been sharing his vision about the future of MODX on Medium. Based on that, and other discussions, what do we know about MODX 3? What is its status, and when can we expect to see something?&nbsp;</p><p>To be honest, we don't have the answers.

If anything, MODX 3 is a long-term project that is just getting started.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Why do we need MODX 3 anyway?</h2>

<p>The current version of MODX serves a lot of people really well. It enables designers and front-end developers to build completely bespoke websites with minimal effort and core&nbsp;hacking unlike some of the competition. Even in the current iteration, building&nbsp;websites will be easy and completely feasible for many years to come. The very powerful templating language and elements, template variables and extensions like&nbsp;<a href="https://modmo.re/cb" target="_blank">ContentBlocks</a> are all ready for the future.&nbsp;</p><p>The biggest reason that we need a MODX 3 might just be that number. In order to clean up legacy code and to provide developers with better, industry-standard tools, MODX will need breaking changes. And as MODX follows&nbsp;<a href="http://semver.org/">semantic versioning</a>, that means the major version has to increase when that happens. MODX Revolution is version 2, so we need a version 3.&nbsp;</p><p>So why do we need breaking changes, if the current version of MODX is still very much relevant? I would say it is to get MODX up to speed on what's happening in the PHP world. The broader PHP community has been professionalising and&nbsp;standardising (in part thanks to the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.php-fig.org/" target="_blank">Framework Interoperability Group</a> and initiatives like&nbsp;<a href="http://www.phptherightway.com/" target="_blank">PHP: The Right Way</a>)&nbsp;at an amazing pace over the past few years. By hooking into this movement, the MODX core code can become a lot more awesome (read: stable, testable and potentially smaller) and in turn MODX would become a much more appealing content platform for the PHP&nbsp;developer group.</p><p>In the development world, breaking changes happen all the time. With the exception of the bump from Evo to Revo,&nbsp;MODX has been really stable and iterating progressively over the past decade, but at some point a breaking release needs to happen to iterate beyond what the current code allows.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Not Invented Here Syndrom</h2>

<p>In many ways, MODX was (unintentionally)&nbsp;built&nbsp;with the&nbsp;concept of <em style="background-color: initial;"><strong>Not Invented Here (NIH)</strong></em>, which is not a great design pattern.&nbsp;This basically means that where previously every part of the code&nbsp;was developed internally, in the future more standardised libraries developed by the wider community&nbsp;can be used. This shift has happened across the PHP community over the past few&nbsp;years thanks to&nbsp;<a href="http://getcomposer.org" target="_blank">Composer</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://packagist.org/" target="_blank">Packagist</a> making it extremely easy to use code from third parties and the rise of libraries that are exceptionally good at one, well-defined task.&nbsp;</p><p>By adopting these third party libraries, it is possible to develop solid applications quicker and&nbsp;better by taking advantage of fully unit tested code. Given how MODX currently doesn't really have any useful unit tests (<a href="https://github.com/modxcms/revolution/pull/12424" target="_blank">though there is movement</a>), this is a very big deal when it comes to an architecture and code quality perspective.&nbsp;</p><p>Some examples of places that were developed "in-house" before that we could&nbsp;see adopting outside libraries include the following:</p><ul>

<h2>What is Slim, and why use that?</h2>

<p><a href="https://medium.com/@drumshaman/keeping-modx-relevant-part-two-15a37eab5b48" target="_blank">In part two of the Keeping MODX Relevant series</a>, Jason mentioned&nbsp;<a href="http://www.slimframework.com/" target="_blank">Slim</a> (v3) as the likely candidate to be at the core of MODX. This has not gone unnoticed, with many people looking into Slim, wondering what it does, and how it will work.&nbsp;</p><p>Here's what you need to know about Slim:</p><ul>

<h2>What about the Manager and ExtJS?</h2>

<p>If you ask a random&nbsp;group of MODXers about their least favourite part of the system, it is quite likely ExtJS (or more generally "the manager") ranks incredibly&nbsp;high on that list.&nbsp;At this point there is not a defined direction for the manager that I know off, but sticking with ExtJS 3.4 is likely not going to happen. ExtJS 3 is very old, not very fast or mobile friendly,&nbsp;and it no longer receives updates as ExtJS 6 is already in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sencha.com/blog/announcing-ext-js-6-early-access-release/" target="_blank">early access</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>So while we don't know what the new manager will look like, or what it will be built with yet, we can be pretty confident it wont be ExtJS 3.&nbsp;</p><p>But what do we know?</p><p>Given Jason's choice for Slim as the core library to build on, his work on something called&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/opengeek/tacit" target="_blank">Tacit</a> ("<em>a high performance RESTful framework"</em>, coincidentally&nbsp;based on Slim)&nbsp;and some of the discussions on various IRC and&nbsp;<a href="[[~26]]" target="_blank">Slack</a>, it seems likely the next manager will see&nbsp;a RESTful API as base.&nbsp;The current manager also has an API, but its structure is not very standard, and&nbsp;somewhat geared&nbsp;towards what ExtJS expects from an API.&nbsp;It is definitely not RESTful.&nbsp;</p><p>By moving to a RESTful API as core service, the back-end and the actual interface will be further separated from a code perspective.

<h2>What's next?</h2>

<p>Right now, Jason is working on the highly anticipated part three of his series on the future of MODX. In that part, he'll share his vision on the subject of <em>persistence</em>&nbsp;- basically, interacting with the database. For the architecture of MODX this is a very important decision to make and Jason is spending time prototyping some&nbsp;possible solutions before publishing the results.</p><p>For now, the primary&nbsp;focus of MODX&nbsp;is on 2.3 and the upcoming 2.4.
