        <p>A few days ago, a new Markdown editor for MODX was released. For those of you not yet familiar with Markdown: now would be a perfect time to catch up!

So let’s just dive in and see how it works&hellip;</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>The easiest way to install the package, is of course through the package manager. But you can also clone the Git repository and install it with Git Package Management, so you’re always on the latest code and can help with testing or contributing to the project. Instructions for that can be found&nbsp;<a href="http://theboxer.github.io/markdown-editor/contributing/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><p>The Markdown editor works like any other add-on text editor, so after the package is installed, you have to change the <em>which_editor</em>&nbsp;system setting to Markdown Editor in order to make it work.</p>

<h2>The Editor</h2>

<p>Ok, so what does a resource look like now with the new editor in place?</p>

<p>As you can see, the Content field is split up into 2 sections now. The one on the left is where you place the Markdown formatted content, and on the right is your live preview. Yes, that’s right.. You can see what it looks like in HTML <strong>in real time</strong>.

<h2>Coolest Features of Markdown Editor</h2>

<p>On top of the standard Markdown goodness, this MODX extra comes with a lot of other interesting features. The live preview you’ve seen, but there’s also:</p>

<h2>What if other users want to use another RTE?</h2>

<p>Although this is possible by simply adding a <em>which_editor</em> system setting to their user account (or user group), it does however have 1 major limitation. Markdown for MODX does store the generated HTML in the content table, so users with a different RTE can view and edit this content just fine&hellip; But by doing this, the Markdown markup will not be changed. This is stored in it’s own database table, so if you reload and save the same page again with the Markdown editor enabled, all changes will be overwritten. Just keep that in mind when you want to try this out.</p>


<figure class="content-image extended-width ">

</figure>



<h2>Limitations compared to a “regular” RTE</h2>

<p>With most RTE’s it is possible to add additional styling to elements by adding classes to their HTML tags.</p>

<pre><code class="language-markup">&lt;p class=&quot;lead&quot;&gt;Lead text, for example, is fairly common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;button&quot;&gt;Or links styled as buttons...&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>

<p>This <del>is not possible</del> is a bit tricky, because it involves&nbsp;<a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#html" target="_blank">adding the HTML inline</a>. I tried that, and it works, although still a little shaky (= not client proof ;)) at the moment with the MODX Markdown Editor. And of course you can’t switch here to HTML view like most regular RTE’s, so the HTML will always be in your markup.</p><p>Also, creating tables with Markdown can be a bit of a hassle, and it is only supported in&nbsp;<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/#tables" target="_blank">Github Flavored Markdown</a>.</p>

    <p>The core philosophy of Markdown is focused on ease of use: be as easy-to-read and easy-to-write as feasible. If you have mastered web surfing, can type, and know how to copy/paste links to websites, you possess the technical skills you need to use Markdown Editor.</p>
