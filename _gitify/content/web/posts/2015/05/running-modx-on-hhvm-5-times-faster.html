introtext: "<p>Every Friday the entire team at <a href=\"https://www.sterc.nl/nl/\">Sterc</a>, a Dutch agency, spends their afternoon hacking on projects, and trying out new technologies. Recently they worked on running MODX on <em>HHVM</em>, a relatively new virtual machine that runs the Hack PHP compiler developed by Facebook.</p>\r\n<p>And the results? MODX runs up to five times faster on HHVM, compared to standard PHP. </p>"
