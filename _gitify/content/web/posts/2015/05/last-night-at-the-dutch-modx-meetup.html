        <p>What happens in Alkmaar, apparently doesn't stay in Alkmaar! Last night, a group of 11 MODX developers and designers (including a German and Belgian) came together at the RAADHUIS office in&nbsp;Alkmaar, The Netherlands,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.meetup.com/modx-nederland/events/221595287/" target="_blank">for a&nbsp;MODX Meetup</a>. The meetup included pizza and 4 talks around the subject "Workflow".</p>

<h2>First things first: Pizza &amp; Drinks</h2>

<p>The hosts of this meetup took great care of the attendees by providing much-appreciated pizza, beer and other drinks. The RAADHUIS team gave a quick tour of the office and talked about the history of the agency, as well as the unique&nbsp;building, before officially&nbsp;kicking off the meetup with the first talk.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

</figure>



<h2>Talk 1: Project Workflow by Jorgen</h2>

<p>The first talk was by the host of the meetup Jorgen Holzmann. He gave a talk about the general project workflow at RAADHUIS and the different stages that is in. He also followed with a description of their "basic"&nbsp;website workflow, which includes creating a copy of&nbsp;a base site hosted on MODX cloud and developing there until the site was ready for production, which is when they would extract the site onto their reseller hosting.</p><p>One of the parts of the general workflow at RAADHUIS that I found interesting is that their roots are very much offline/print design oriented. In their project&nbsp;workflow, this is recognised in the fact that most projects start with the design phase, which are then turned into an online design, turned into&nbsp;markup and then into a MODX site. This led to quite a bit of interesting discussion.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Talk 2: RAADHUIS Workflow 2.0 by Henk (Bart)</h2>

<p>Next up was Jorgen's&nbsp;colleague Henk, whose real name is Bart but because there are already two other Barts at RAADHUIS they just call him Henk instead. Henk, or Bart, talked about their MODX development workflow version two that they have been implementing more&nbsp;recently. He also discussed a project they worked on recently to show how they approached the client needs and development.</p><p>On top of what they've already been doing, this workflow leans heavily on Grunt for handling deployments to client servers over FTP - an interesting use case for Grunt, which most people only use for compiling and&nbsp;compressing various assets.&nbsp;</p>

</figure>



<h2>Talk 3: Iterating on Workflows by Gauke Pieter</h2>

<p>After a break, Gauke Pieter followed with a presentation showing how their development&nbsp;workflow changed and improved over the years. Starting with working directly online, they eventually got to a point where the workflow is dominated by a standardised&nbsp;Vagrant machine and a dedicated centralised&nbsp;MySQL server. These changes were necessary because the&nbsp;internet connection in Surhuisterveen is fairly limited and the growth of the team were straining their ability to work online.</p><p>With their current workflow, developers can work on their local machine until the project&nbsp;is ready for the&nbsp;staging server and eventually production. They now use git to deploy changes to staging and production.&nbsp;</p><p>Gauke Pieter also invited everyone to join their <em>Feature Fridays</em>, which is their innovation time every Friday from 12:30 until 17:00 where they work on all kinds of innovative (and sometimes fairly&nbsp;random) projects in small groups.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sterc.nl/nl/blog/design-en-development/100-uren-per-week-experimenteren" target="_blank">Read more (in Dutch) on the Sterc blog</a>.</p>

<h2>Talk 4: Solving the Workflow by Mark</h2>

<p>In my talk I introduced MODX.today as a project that we work on&nbsp;with Gitify. Gitify is a command line toolkit that gives you the ability to easily create file-based representations of any MODX object (resources, elements, settings, users, form customisation, ACLs, third party packages..) that can be committed to git, and restored into a MODX installation later or on a different server.&nbsp;</p><p>Combining some of the utilities Gitify ships with and some <em>magical </em>features like automatic ID conflict resolution and cleaning up orphaned objects, we discussed how a workflow can be set up so it works for you. This was heavily based on the actual workflow we use on MODX.today pretty much every day, but we also talked about&nbsp;other possibilities such as GitifyWatch and using a gulp plugin that automatically builds changes into MODX.&nbsp;</p><p>Followed by some ways of how the deployments can be automated and a quick demo, the attendees seemed really impressed by what Gitify can do. Some of the attendees had already tried Gitify a couple of months ago, but now they realised it's <em>more than just a glorified mysqldump</em>, which might just need to become the Gitify tagline!</p><p>As Gitify was very well received, I'll be writing up a full tutorial about setting up a workflow with it soon. The&nbsp;<a href="[[~3]]">Building MODX.today</a> post covers it at a high level already, but there's a lot more to say about&nbsp;that.</p>

<h2>In closing</h2>

<p>Thanks Jorgen and the rest of the RAADHUIS team for hosting the meetup. I personally had a great time, and from all the discussions throughout the evening I'm pretty sure others had too. See you next time!</p>
