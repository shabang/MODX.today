<h2>Why Dash is awesome</h2>

<p>No matter what you work with - if there's documentation or a reference&nbsp;involved, Dash will be able of displaying it quicker than Google. Its key feature is the incredibly powerful&nbsp;search. Just start typing and you will immediately see the documentation. Forgot wether PHP's array_key_exists expects the key or the array first? The answer is right there, right now.&nbsp;</p>

	You know what's even better? It is all offline. There's no need for an internet connection, and it's lightning fast.</p><p>
	To be able of browsing a certain documentation, you need to download a <em>docset</em>. This is a specially prepared file that contains the entire documentation, including the index. Creating a docset is a fair&nbsp;bit of work, but thankfully there are docsets available for mostly any programming&nbsp;language or framework, and even many tools have a docset available. A selection of our favourites&nbsp;includes PHP, PHPUnit, Symfony, Twig, PhpStorm, Foundation, Compass, CSS, JavaScript, Backbone, Font Awesome, MySQL, jQuery, Sass and Emoji.&nbsp;</p><p>
	Once you've installed Dash from the app store or the website, the <em>Download Docsets </em>button is right there that will let you browse this vast library of documentation.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Installing the MODX Docset</h2>

<p>To get the MODX docset installed in Dash, simply click <em>Download Docsets </em>on the dashboard, or to go Dash &gt; Preferences and then the Downloads button. In the sidebar, under <em>Other Docsets</em>, choose <em>User Contributed </em>and search for MODX.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Simply hit the download button, and Dash will take it from there. Next time you want to double check the getResources properties, just type in getresources in the search bar, and the answer is available immediately. If you already know what you're looking to search for, anything you enter after a space will be searched within the open document.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Changes to the official RTFM are not automatically updated in the docset, however whenever a new version of the docset is published Dash will automatically update your local copy.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://kapeli.com/dash" target="_blank">Dash is available as a free, fully functional trial</a>, but can be upgrade to the full version for only â‚¬19,99 - money that is easily earned back by not spending as much time on google or stack overflow to find the right documentation.&nbsp;</p>
