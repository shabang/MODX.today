        <p>The team at Sterc is once again working on something cool! This time 
it's called Formalicious, and it's a new extra for MODX that lets you 
build forms easily. We gave the new beta a quick spin for you, our 
lovely readers.</p>

<h2>Installing the Beta<br></h2>

<p>The beta package is <a href="http://www.stercx.com/extras/formalicious-beta" target="_blank">available from the StercX website</a>, and comes as a transport package. Just download the package, go to the package installer and use the new "Upload Package" option (under the arrow on the Download Packages button) to upload the package to your site. Find it in the grid and hit install.</p><p>After the package has been installed, refresh the page to see a new entry called Formalicious under Extras. </p>

<h2>Setting up the first Form<br></h2>

<p>In the component, we're immediately directed to an admin section (by the button in the top right) to add some categories.&nbsp;</p>


<figure class="content-image extended-width ">
    <img data-src="/assets/uploads/images/2015/05/formaliciousadmin.jpg" class="lazyload" alt="The Admin section of Formalicious, showing an empty categories table." >
    <figcaption>The Admin section of Formalicious, showing an empty categories table.<br></figcaption>
</figure>



<p>After adding a category, we can go back to the main Formalicious component to add our form. It's pretty straightforward - just fill in the form settings. Sending emails and autoresponders seems to be baked in, which is a great feature for clients.</p>


<figure class="content-image extended-width ">
    <img data-src="/assets/uploads/images/2015/05/form.jpg" class="lazyload" alt="Creating a form step 1: Form Settings with email and autoresponders built in." >
    <figcaption>Creating a form step 1: Form Settings with email and autoresponders built in.<br></figcaption>
</figure>



<p>Hit save, and you're ready to start adding fields to the form.</p>

<h2>Creating the Form Fields<br></h2>

<p>In Formalicious, each form is built from different steps. So to add fields, you actually add steps, and add fields to each of them. These are later shown as different pages within the form.</p><p>In the example form I'm setting up, we ask for author information on the first step, and details about an article that author has written on the second step. If you haven't figured it out yet, I'm creating a copy of our <a href="[[~7]]">Submit an Article</a> page ;)</p><p>Each step is shown as a tab here, and you can double click the tab name to change its name. They can also be dragged and dropped for reordering. </p>


<figure class="content-image extended-width ">
    <img data-src="/assets/uploads/images/2015/05/form1.jpg" class="lazyload" alt="Two steps in this form." >
    <figcaption>Two steps in this form.<br></figcaption>
</figure>



<p>Adding a field is easy too. Just hit the button, choose the type of field (which can be managed from the Admin page in the component) and fill in the details. Again it's possible to drag &amp; drop them to change the order. We repeat this for each of the steps to create our form.&nbsp;</p>


<figure class="content-image extended-width ">
    <img data-src="/assets/uploads/images/2015/05/firstform.jpg" class="lazyload" alt="" >
    
</figure>



<h2>Adding the Form to the website<br></h2>

<p>To add the form to a page, the Sterc team recommends using a listbox template variable with all the created forms, and they provided the value needed for the input options:</p>

<pre><code class="language-markup">@SELECT '- No form selected -' AS name, 0 AS id UNION ALL SELECT name,id FROM modx_formalicious_forms WHERE published = 1</code></pre>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: if your table prefix is not modx_, be sure to change it in the SQL query. Otherwise you might not get the results you expect.</p><p>With the template variable added, you can go to a resource and select the form from the list. </p><p>Next up, you'll need to add the renderForm snippet to your page or template, like below, but make sure the template variable name matches what you named yours.</p>

<pre><code class="language-markup">&#91;&#91;!renderForm? &amp;form=`&#91;&#91;*form&#93;&#93;`&#93;&#93;</code></pre>

<p>Now you can watch your form in action!</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: Formalicious relies on Formit (at least version 2.2.2). Make sure you have this installed!</p>


<figure class="content-image extended-width ">
    <img data-src="/assets/uploads/images/2015/05/yayform.jpg" class="lazyload" alt="" >
    
</figure>



<p>At this stage, Formalicious already added (server-side) validation and a "Next" button to move to the second step. In the second step, as you can see below, there's a link to go back and also to submit the form.&nbsp;</p><p>It doesn't seem to prefill the information filled in earlier when clicking the previous link, but that is probably just a <a href="https://github.com/Sterc/Formalicious/issues/14" target="_blank">bug</a> in this beta.</p>


<figure class="content-image extended-width ">
    <img data-src="/assets/uploads/images/2015/05/form2.JPG" class="lazyload" alt="" >
    
</figure>



<p>After hitting submit, Formalicious sends an email with all the details and (thanks to the new FormSave features in FormIt 2.2) stores the contents under Extras &gt; FormIt too.</p><p>Although there are a few bugs, Formalicious is working quite nicely for a beta.
