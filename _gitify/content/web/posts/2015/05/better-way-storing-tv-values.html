introtext: '<p>When using checkbox, listbox and radio type TVs, you are&nbsp;probably used to defining the values in the TV properties. But if you want to change those values to fix a typo, you will lose the selections on all resources that have that value selected. The team at Qaraqter found that unacceptable, and came up with a solution in the form of a new extra called <em>Set Input Options</em>, which is available today.</p>'

        <p>In the Swiss army knife that is MODX, TV’s still play a major role in creating and managing your content. There’s a few different input types available, and I’m sure you’re also using the checkbox, listbox and radio types every now and then.

<h2>How to use Set Input Options to manage your TV’s</h2>

<p>Set Input Options is a very basic CMP that allows you to create groups with their own input options. These options can then be used in TV's, for checkboxes / listboxes etc. Unlike the default Man||Bear||Pig input options, the CMP is easy enough for clients to understand, in case you want them to be able of managing the values.</p><p>To set it up, you have to go through the following steps:</p><ol>
<li>Install SetInputOptions through the package manager</li><li>Go to <em>Extras</em> &gt; <em>Set Input Options</em> and create a group with some options</li><li>Create a TV with an @SELECT binding in the Input Options Value field, that points to the options created in step 2 (see example below)</li><li>Fetch the input option values in your content with the getInputOptions or Rowboat snippets</li></ol>


<figure class="content-image extended-width ">
    <img data-src="/assets/uploads/images/2015/05/Screen_Shot_2015_05_18_at_10.49.55.png" class="lazyload" alt="Showing a list of options in a group in the Set Input Options component." >
    <figcaption>Showing a list of options in a group in the Set Input Options component.</figcaption>
</figure>



<h3>Connect your TV to your custom input options</h3>

<p>An example of an @SELECT binding for checkboxes and radios:</p>

<pre><code class="language-markup">@SELECT `name` AS `name`,`id` FROM `&#91;&#91;+PREFIX&#93;&#93;setinputoptions_inputoptions` WHERE `group` = 2 AND `softDelete` = 0 ORDER BY `position`</code></pre>

<p>An example @SELECT binding for listboxes and multiselects. Note the first part up till <em>UNION ALL</em>. This adds an empty first item to your TV, so by default, nothing will be selected.</p>

<pre><code class="language-markup">@SELECT '' AS name, '' AS id UNION ALL ( SELECT `name` AS `name`,`id` FROM `&#91;&#91;+PREFIX&#93;&#93;setinputoptions_inputoptions` WHERE `group` = 1 AND `softDelete` = 0 ORDER BY `position` )</code></pre>

<p><strong>Important</strong> Don’t forget to use a `,` as output delimiter, in order for the getInputOptions snippet to work!</p>

<h3>Display input option values using the getInputOptions snippet</h3>

<p>To reconnect the unique ID of the input option to the name that needs to be displayed, you can use the getInputOptions snippet. This snippet needs a comma separated list of ID’s as input, which it will get from the TV. By default, only the name of the value is being displayed, but you can use your own tpl chunk to override this.</p>

<pre><code class="language-markup">&#91;&#91;getInputOptions? &amp;tv=`&#91;&#91;*your_template_variable&#93;&#93;` &amp;tpl=`yourTplChunk`&#93;&#93;</code></pre>

<p><strong>Available Properties:</strong></p><ul>
<li><b style="background-color: initial;"></b>tpl</li><li>delimiter</li><li>outputDelimiter</li></ul><p><strong>Available Placeholders in the row tpl:</strong></p><ul>
<li>name</li><li>alias</li></ul>

<h2>Display input option values using the Rowboat snippet</h2>

<p>You can also use&nbsp;<a href="http://rtfm.modx.com/extras/revo/rowboat" target="_blank">Rowboat</a> to list all the options in a group. Useful for example, for creating filter buttons. Don't forget to download and install Rowboat separately through the package manager!</p>

<pre><code class="language-markup">&#91;&#91;Rowboat?
    &amp;table=`modx_setinputoptions_inputoptions`
    &amp;tpl=`filterButtonsRow`
    &amp;limit=`10`
    &amp;sortBy=`position`
    &amp;where=`{&quot;group&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}`
&#93;&#93;</code></pre>

<p>It’s not spacecraft technology or anything, but we’re finding it very useful for maintaining TV’s in all of our projects. It makes things more solid and flexible. So if you ever find yourself fiddling with missing TV values again, this might just save your day...</p><p>All credits go out to my colleague Robin Rijkeboer, for writing the actual code, and to Git Package Management, for making the process of creating extra’s such a breeze.</p><p>If you have any questions or issues,&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/Qaraqter/set-input-options/issues" target="_blank">please let us know</a>!</p>
