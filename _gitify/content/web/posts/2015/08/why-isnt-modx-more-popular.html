The CMS market is huge, and <strong>converting to a different CMS often depends on personal recommendations or seeing someone use it</strong>. This is why WordPress keeps growing and growing, as everyone knows someone that built a site on WordPress.&nbsp;</p><p>Late last year a new PHP usergroup was started in my area with monthly meetups, talking about all sorts of PHP-related subjects. As I've been interested in learning more about the best practices in PHP outside of what we've been doing in MODX, I've attended most of those meetups&nbsp;since. While doing so, I also made sure that my introduction on Meetup.com included MODX. While it's not a big ad, or a very compelling statement that gets people to change all their processes, it kept coming up casually&nbsp;in discussions. People asked what it was at the meetup, and at some point I decided to reach out to the organisers&nbsp;and see if I could do a full talk about it at&nbsp;one of the meetups.&nbsp;</p><p>Last month that finally happened as I gave my talk titled&nbsp;<a href="www.slideshare.net/hamstramark1/unleashing-creative-freedom-with-modx-20150721-php-frl" target="_blank">Unleashing Creative Freedom with MODX</a> at the PHP FRL user group. Rather than a 2 minute elevator pitch over a beer, people got the full introduction of MODX, and learned about&nbsp;the most important concepts and other tools they need to build their first website in MODX. I think it was well received, and may have gotten MODX a couple of new users that night.&nbsp;</p><p>Later this month, I'll be doing the same talk again, this time for a larger group of developers at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.meetup.com/PHP-Zwolle/events/222618340/" target="_blank">the first PHP Zwolle meetup</a>.&nbsp;What started as a simple mention that I specialised in MODX, turned into two talks already, and likely more to follow.&nbsp;</p><p><strong style="background-color: initial;">To make the&nbsp;MODX community&nbsp;grow,&nbsp;I think that's what we need to do:&nbsp;talk to our peers in person</strong>. Dropping in MODX on a bio or having dedicated pages about MODX&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gelstudios.co.uk/services/support/modx-consultancy" target="_blank">on</a> <a href="http://www.qodo.co.uk/services/modx-development/" target="_blank">your</a> <a href="https://eternitywebdev.com/content-management-systems.html" target="_blank">site</a> is a great start, but I think&nbsp;that's not enough to convince web professionals to try out MODX. They need more insight into how it fits with their processes and services.&nbsp;</p><p>User groups related to the web (whether PHP, JavaScript, SEO etc)&nbsp;are a great place to do this talking. People attending&nbsp;have already expressed an interest in learning and sharing knowledge, and as you surely know MODX has a pretty&nbsp;unique offering that can help those people deliver better projects.&nbsp;If we can convince the web&nbsp;professionals to include MODX in their toolkit, they will educate their clients about the possibilities, and together we can&nbsp;make a grassroots effort to grow MODX.&nbsp;</p><p>Let's start&nbsp;talking more&nbsp;with people outside our community, sharing experiences and learning more together.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>If this article convinced you to seek out local user groups to give a talk about MODX, I would be happy to provide you with the Keynote file of my "Unleashing Creative Freedom with MODX"&nbsp;slides to give you a bit of a head start on your preparation.&nbsp;Just send me an email via mark@modmore.com</em>.&nbsp;</p>
