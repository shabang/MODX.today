        <p>This is the story of a Snippet I once wrote, how it started out as a very simple way of doing a specific task and how MODX enabled it to become something more -- something super.</p>
<h2>Simple &quot;problem&quot; solving</h2>
<p>I am building a site in <strong>MODX Revolution</strong> and I start by making a template for an article with the <code>pagetitle</code> placeholder in an <code>h1</code>-tag, <code>introtext</code> in a <code>p</code>-tag (with a class of <code>intro</code>) and <code>content</code> not wrapped in anything -- I use a rich-text editor, so the markup is of course already there. All is well, until one of the users of the site wants to leave <code>introtext</code> empty... that leaves us with an empty paragraph beneath the page's title -- not pretty, especially when that paragraph has a bottom margin I can't get rid of.</p>
<p>But this is MODX, so it's not a problem at all. Pretty fix:</p>

<pre><code class="language-markup">&#91;&#91;*introtext:ne=``:then=`&lt;p class=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;&#91;&#91;*introtext&#93;&#93;&lt;/p&gt;`&#93;&#93;</code></pre>

<p>Even prettier fix:</p>

<pre><code class="language-markup">&#91;&#91;If?
    &amp;subject=`&#91;&#91;*introtext&#93;&#93;`
    &amp;operator=`notempty`
    &amp;then=`&lt;p class=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;&#91;&#91;*introtext&#93;&#93;&lt;/p&gt;`
&#93;&#93;</code></pre>

<p>Problem fixed, time to move on! Right? Sure! Only, I suddenly feel an urge to not have MODX parse the <code>introtext</code> placeholder more than necessary. So what can I do? I'll create a Snippet -- more specifically, an <a href="https://rtfm.modx.com/revolution/2.x/making-sites-with-modx/customizing-content/input-and-output-filters-%28output-modifiers%29" title="Read about it in the MODX Docs">output modifier</a>!</p>
<h2>Enter wrap</h2>
<p>I name my Snippet <code>wrap</code> and put one line of code in it:</p>

<pre><code class="language-php">return (empty($input) === false &amp;&amp; strpos($options, '|') !== false) ? str_replace('|', $input, $options) : '';</code></pre>

<p>And here's how I use it to solve my empty paragraph problem:</p>

<pre><code class="language-markup">&#91;&#91;*introtext:wrap=`&lt;p class=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;|&lt;/p&gt;`&#93;&#93;</code></pre>

<p>So all it does is check if both <code>$input</code> is not empty <em>and</em> <code>$options</code> has a pipe-character in it? And if both these conditions are met, then go ahead and replace the pipe with the value in <code>$input</code> and then return the result? Yes! That's what it does!</p>
<h2>There's more</h2>
<p>For me, this is a cool little Snippet, capable of solving one tiny little &quot;problem&quot;. And that's all, until I suddenly find another use for it: mailto-links!</p>

<pre><code class="language-markup">&#91;&#91;*email:wrap=`&lt;a href=&quot;mailto:|&quot;&gt;|&lt;/a&gt;`&#93;&#93;</code></pre>

<p>Of course it replaces multiple pipes! Now the Snippet is going from cool to beautiful! I'm really proud. But now it turns super, by fixing a problem that is even greater than both empty paragraphs and duplicate placeholders in mailto-links, combined!</p>

<pre><code class="language-markup">&#91;&#91;getResources?
    &amp;parents=`-1`
    &amp;resources=`&#91;&#91;*comma_separated_id_list&#93;&#93;`
    &amp;tpl=`ResourceListTemplate`
    &amp;sortby=`FIELD(modResource.id, &#91;&#91;*comma_separated_id_list&#93;&#93; )`
    &amp;sortdir=`ASC`
&#93;&#93;</code></pre>

<p>This <strong>getResources</strong> call works perfectly, just don't leave the <em>comma_separated_id_list</em> empty. The result is an incomplete sorting clause in the query to the database, MODX throwing errors and clients getting angry. Not good. Easy to fix? Sure! Just do this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-markup">&#91;&#91;&#91;&#91;If?
    &amp;subject=`&#91;&#91;*comma_separated_id_list&#93;&#93;`
    &amp;operator=`notempty`
    &amp;then=`$ResourceListWrapper`
    &amp;else=`-empty`
&#93;&#93;&#93;&#93;</code></pre>

<p>That's it, right? Of course not! I'm the guy who had to take care of an empty paragraph by adding a tiny little Snippet capable of (up until now) only helping out with two tiny problems. So, can <code>wrap</code> &quot;save&quot; the day, yet again? Here's why it went from beautiful to super:</p>

<pre><code class="language-markup">&amp;sortby=`&#91;&#91;*comma_separated_id_list:wrap=`FIELD(modResource.id, | )`:default=`menuindex`&#93;&#93;`</code></pre>

<p>Now we can lose the <strong>If</strong>-call and don't worry about empty template variables. I even get to add a default sorting field!</p>
<p>So there you have it. That's the how and why. The reasoning and solutions are purely subjective and there may be other, better alternatives out there, but the point is: this is what makes MODX so great! To me MODX is an excellent extension of programming. There's never just <em>one</em> way to do something. MODX lets me create something quickly and then gives me the option to easily use it in ways I never even imagined. That's why it's so super!</p>
