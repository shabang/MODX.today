introtext: '<p>The latest release of Font Awesome, 4.5.0, now contains the MODX logo! Initially requested in <a href="https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/issues/3455">May 2014</a>, after 191 comments to the request it was added yesterday. This puts MODX in a very limited list of content management systems outside "the big three" that have their logos <a href="http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icon/modx/">in Font Awesome</a>.</p>'
