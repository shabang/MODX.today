<p>Now I don't want to pop a pleasant bubble where MODX is&nbsp;so close to WordPress in usage share, but obviously this was not a very scientific research piece. It is based on a twitter survey with 1300 responses which was shared by the official MODX social media accounts, so unfortunately it is unlikely to be a very accurate representation.&nbsp;It does give MODX some great recognition as a serious player in the CMS world. The fact MODX shows up in a survey like this at all, with great competitors like the others in the list, is awesome in itself.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>5% Market Share in Russia</h2>

<p>A more scientific survey was published by the Russian website <em>RUWARD / TRACK</em>&nbsp;<a href="http://track.ruward.ru/cms/201503" target="_blank">recently</a> with their quarterly CMS Usage Report. They track what systems are used on .ru websites by scraping the content and attempting to hit specific urls (such as /manager/) to see what system is being used.&nbsp;<a href="http://modx.com/blog/2012/05/29/why-we-dont-do-powered-by-by-default/" target="_blank">While&nbsp;MODX is not quite as easy to track</a> compared to most of the competition, they did manage to find a whopping 54.200&nbsp;websites, or 4,9% of the total websites they checked,&nbsp;running on&nbsp;MODX.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of course&nbsp;WordPress and Joomla dominate the&nbsp;Russian market with half of the market share, but coming in fourth MODX still has a really great score with 4,9% of the tracked&nbsp;websites on the .ru top level domain. As Russia is a very important and big&nbsp;market for MODX, seeing that number grow is a very good sign.</p>
