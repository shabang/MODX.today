        <p>While most people will use MODX to power custom designs, having themes available can be extremely useful for those "spare time" projects, or as a starting point to customise further.&nbsp;In our first Theme Review, we've taken a good hard look at the SOLO theme by MPThemes. We reviewed version 1.1.1 which was released on April 24th, 2015.&nbsp;</p><p>SOLO is a responsive,&nbsp;one-page website theme that's available for €22 per site.</p><p>After a very smooth checkout process (supporting Credit Card and PayPal), the theme is provided as a package that can be installed via package manager.

<h2>Design &amp; Front-end</h2>

<p>With the Design &amp; Front-end aspect of this review, we look at what the theme offers and what it looks like. Tastes differ, so we wont judge based on colors or even fonts, but we do look at what&nbsp;the default install offers, what features are included and how easy it is to customise it to your own taste and requirements.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>First Impression</h3>

<p>The first impression of the theme&nbsp;is quite good, with a nice full-screen background&nbsp;image with text overlay. There are some typos in the default text that would give a more professional impression when fixed, but you'll be replacing that anyway.&nbsp;</p>


<figure class="content-image extended-width ">
    <img data-src="/assets/uploads/images/2015/05/solo_home.png" class="lazyload" alt="" >
    
</figure>



<h3>Standard Features</h3>

<p>As it's a one-page website, the navigation you see scrolls you down to the specific sections with a nice animated scroll effect, while keeping the navigation in view at all times.&nbsp;The menu items also have an active state, so you can see where on the page you are. One minor issue here is that clicking an item in the navigation doesn't update the anchor in the link.&nbsp;</p><p>The fixed menu also takes up a good 100px, which could be problematic on smaller screens - were it not that the entire menu is hidden on mobile resolutions. The lack of a navigation on a single page website is acceptable, but maybe a different representation of the menu for smaller viewports makes sense as future improvement.&nbsp;</p><p>When scrolling down the page, the sections of the page are hidden by default but&nbsp;fade in smoothly.&nbsp;The theme also includes a variety of different section types, including a three column feature grid, two columns with a list of benefits, gallery, quotes, team slider,&nbsp;pricing tables and a contact form. In the Back-end Management review we'll look closer at how those are managed too.</p>

<h2>Theme Customisation</h2>

<p>After looking at the theme in its default state, we also want to see what we can customise. As with most other themes, SOLO uses&nbsp;<a href="http://modx.com/extras/package/clientconfig" target="_blank">ClientConfig</a> to manage a bunch of colors and other site-wide settings, so without touching a single line of CSS or HTML&nbsp;it is possible to completely alter the looks of the website.&nbsp;</p>

    <figcaption>9 tabs of configuration covering all major features and colors.</figcaption>
</figure>



<p>To see how far we can go with those settings, here's are two screenshots. On the left, the default out-of-the-box design, and on the right configured to be orange on black instead.&nbsp;Click the images to view them in a bit more detail&nbsp;in a new tab.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>The theme seems to hold up quite nicely despite the radically different colors. What's also interesting about this, is that the theme automatically writes your colors to an actual css file, instead of just putting it into&nbsp;an inline style tag in&nbsp;the page header.</p>

<h2>Back-end Management</h2>

<p>The content editing is done through a MIGX Template Variable, where each section of the page&nbsp;is a row in the TV. This is quite flexible, and the modal reloads when you choose a section type to provide you a section-type specific configuration.&nbsp;</p>


<figure class="content-image extended-width ">

    <figcaption>Managing the page content is done via the Sections Template Variable, using MIGX.</figcaption>

<p>Given this is a one page theme, I'm not a big fan of managing all of that in a&nbsp;template variable like this. It does provide a ton of&nbsp;flexibility thanks to the built-in section&nbsp;types, but it's not the best user experience for an end user trying to manage their site.&nbsp;</p><p>A more user friendly approach could be using multiple resources and combining those into a single page, or a Premium Extra like&nbsp;<a href="https://modmo.re/cb" target="_blank">ContentBlocks</a>.

<h2>Code Quality</h2>
