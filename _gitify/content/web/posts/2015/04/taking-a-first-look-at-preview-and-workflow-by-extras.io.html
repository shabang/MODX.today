        <h2>What is Preview?</h2>

<p>Before diving into the awesomeness that is Workflow, it probably makes sense to introduce&nbsp;<a href="https://extras.io/extras/preview/" target="_blank">Preview</a> first. Workflow is an extension of Preview, and given Preview is still pretty new, most people probably have not used it yet.&nbsp;</p><p>Preview allows you to create <strong>revisions</strong>, different versions,&nbsp;of your resources.

        <p>The real magic happens when previewing revisions in the front-end of your website.

        <p>If you liked the way&nbsp;<a href="http://modx.com/extras/package/versionx" target="_blank">VersionX</a> allows you to compare versions side-by-side (which, for those unaware, shows all resource fields and the raw&nbsp;content side-by-side), you will love seeing the actual resource output side-by-side with Preview.</p>
