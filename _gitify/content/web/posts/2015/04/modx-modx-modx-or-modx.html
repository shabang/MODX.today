	I believe the relaunch and rebranding the FAQ refers to, is the one that happened around the CMS Expo,&nbsp;<a href="http://modx.com/blog/2012/05/17/no-more-hiding-in-plain-sight/">back in May 2012</a>.

<p>Well, a search on Google Images for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=modx+logo" target="_blank">MODX Logo</a> may give an idea.&nbsp;</p><p>Over the years, the&nbsp;project has seen many logo variations and they haven't always used the full uppercase name.

"MODx" has also been incredibly popular for a couple of years&nbsp;and many tutorials and blog posts around the web still use that particular capitalisation.&nbsp;</p>
