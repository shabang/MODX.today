    <img data-src="" class="lazyload" alt="" >

<p>Now look at how Redactor solves this.&nbsp;</p><ol><li>Click the Insert Image button on the toolbar.</li><li>Select the file from their computer.</li></ol><p>At this point, the image&nbsp;will&nbsp;be uploaded and automatically inserted into the content.&nbsp;</p>

	While that upload happened, Redactor may have created a new directory to hold the images based on the defined upload path containing placeholders for dynamic paths&nbsp;(like <code style="line-height: 1.6em;">[[+year:tag]]</code>, <code style="line-height: 1.6em;">[[+month:tag]]</code>, <code style="line-height: 1.6em;">[[+username:tag]]</code>, <code style="line-height: 1.6em;">[[+alias:tag]]</code>,&nbsp;<code style="line-height: 1.6em;">[[+parent_alias:tag]]</code> and more).
