	We see that while many flock to MODX for the creative freedom it provides not everyone can use it. Is the creativity of a person with compromised abilities less valuable than that of another? Of course not. Does a smartphone user's need to author the web stop when they leave their desktop? Of course not. It saddens me to think of all the amazing things that aren't being created due to the technical debt we've absorbed. It doesn't need to stay this way. The MODX API is too brilliant to remain a best kept secret that
	<em>some people</em> on <em>some devices</em> can use.

</blockquote>
<p>
	Accessibility, as defined by the WCAG Guidlines, 
	<em>is not</em> something that can be integrated into MODX&nbsp;2.x without breaking changes; it <em>cannot be bolted on</em>. With talk of breaking changes in the air and <a href="http://a11y.modx.com/">a campaign led by MODX LLC</a> that claims to be able to bolt accessibility onto MODX&nbsp;2.x now is a great time to discuss the MODX project's commitment to accessibility. But what is accessibility&nbsp;<em>really</em>?
</p>
<p>
	Accessibility isn't just about catering experiences for those with compromised 
	<em>personal</em> abilities; it is about creating usable experiences for anybody, anywhere, on any device. You see, when you switch from your desktop to your smartphone contextually you become <em>someone else</em>. You are now a completely different user with different abilities. Your smartphone has compromised abilities such as the number of pixels it can legibly display and the lack of traditional mouse interactions. Unless a website is designed accordingly you may not be able to access it. In fact, your desktop probably has compromised abilities too. Can you put it in your pocket? Can you pinch-zoom the&nbsp;screen?
</p>
<p>
	Your personal abilities along with your device(s), any assistive technology you may be using, and the software you are communicating with collectively construct your experience as a user. So I hate to break it to you but 
	<em>you are disabled</em>. We&nbsp;all&nbsp;are. Everyone&nbsp;of&nbsp;us.

<h2>Freedom isn't&nbsp;free</h2>
<p>
	The MODX API does not get in your way. It allows developers to author front end experiences in their own style, but the flexibility found when authoring <i>with&nbsp;MODX</i> is not often found when we authoring <i>for&nbsp;MODX</i>. Ironically, the manager interface not only gets in the way of designers but stays firmly put. <a href="http://markup.tips/htmlftw">HTML&nbsp;<span data-enunciate="first">1<sup>st</sup></span></a> design isn't welcome within a manager authored and governed entirely by dated JavaScript frameworks. ExtJS&nbsp;3.x adamantly oppose things like Progressive Enhancement, Responsive Design, HTML5, CSS3, and modern JavaScript practices. Also, creative freedom. It opposes that too. We've locked ourselves inside a prison called <a href="http://semver.org/" style="background-color: initial;">semver</a> and no amount of crowdfunding or development cycles alone will free us. To get out <em style="background-color: initial;">we have to start breaking&nbsp;things</em>.

	As we escape past confinements and <a href="https://modx.today/posts/2015/05/what-do-we-know-about-modx-3">learn more about what the future holds for MODX&nbsp;3.x</a> I urge the community to take a close look at how to liberate itself within each layer of whatever new tech stack is decided upon. Creative Freedom should not only be found in the MODX backend, but <em>throughout the entire platform</em>. No longer should we wonder how many creatives we have shut the door on. Instead let us ponder questions like how can we create interfaces that <em>anyone</em> can use <em>anywhere</em>? Can we create dynamic components that can be heard when not seen? How do we collectively <a href="http://a11yproject.com/about.html">define&nbsp;accessibility</a>? Can we put an end to the general perception of there being a single manager? What combination of web standards can be used to enhance components not only progressively but timelessly? How do we build something as powerful as the MODX Manager in a mobile-first way? Should the API utilize a JavaScript framework? If so, which one and to what extent? Or, should we trace our technology stack all the way back to the ubiquity of&nbsp;HTML and web&nbsp;standards?

	So many questions come to mind but I always come back to asking myself what would the state of the web be if MODX were truly and natively accessible to everyone? I believe the MODX Community owes it not only to itself but to the world to answer that question. There is only one way to find out. Let us discover what that could be&nbsp;together.
