<p>Aside from being able&nbsp;of cropping an image, the Image+ template variable&nbsp;does something else a regular image template variable can't do:&nbsp;guarantee a minimal height and width of the selected image. When that happens,&nbsp;Image+ will warn the editor&nbsp;and does not allow to use the image.</p><p>All input and output options of the Image+ custom template variable and the snippet properties are described in the&nbsp;<a href="http://jako.github.io/ImagePlus/" target="_blank">comprehensive documentation</a>. Now let's look at some examples of how you can use Image+.</p>

<h2>Example 1: Keep the Crop</h2>

<p>If you want to use the the selected crop of an Image+ image, but you want to display the image in a different size, you can use the following ImagePlus snippet call:</p>

<pre><code class="language-markup">&#91;&#91;ImagePlus? 
    &amp;tvname=`imageplus` 
    &amp;options=`w=100&amp;h=50&amp;zc=1` 
&#93;&#93;</code></pre>

<p>This call will crop the image first, resizes it to 100px width and 50px height using zoom crop after and returns the url to the image.</p>

<h2>Example 2: Responsive Images</h2>

<p>If you want to create responsive images that uses a crop i.e for the small size, you can use the following ImagePlus snippet call:</p>

<pre><code class="language-markup">&#91;&#91;ImagePlus? 
    &amp;tvname=`imageplus` 
    &amp;options=`w=200` 
    &amp;type=`tpl`
    &amp;tpl=`ImagePlus.responsive`
&#93;&#93;</code></pre>

<p>Assuming you are using the pThumb MODX crop engine you can&nbsp;use the following ImagePlus.responsive chunk:</p>

<pre><code class="language-markup">&lt;picture&gt;
    &lt;source media=&quot;(min-width: 36em)&quot;
        srcset=&quot;&#91;&#91;+source.src:pthumb=`w=1024`&#93;&#93; 1024w,
            &#91;&#91;+source.src:pthumb=`w=640`&#93;&#93; 640w,
            &#91;&#91;+source.src:pthumb=`w=320`&#93;&#93; 320w&quot;
        sizes=&quot;33.3vw&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;source srcset=&quot;&#91;&#91;+source.src:pthumb=`&#91;&#91;+crop.options&#93;&#93;&amp;w=640`&#93;&#93; 2x,
        &#91;&#91;+source.src:pthumb=`&#91;&#91;+crop.options&#93;&#93;&amp;w=320`&#93;&#93; 1x&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;&#91;&#91;+url&#93;&#93;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;</code></pre>

<p>The cropped versions will be served on all browser viewports smaller than 36em in this example.</p><p>In an upcoming version of Image+ you will be able of defining more than one crop for even better&nbsp;support of responsive images.</p>
