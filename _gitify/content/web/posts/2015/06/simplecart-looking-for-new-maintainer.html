<p>As Bert said, this is not the end for SimpleCart. Instead, it's an opportunity for someone else with more time&nbsp;to give SimpleCart a second chance.&nbsp;</p><p>There is no confirmation yet&nbsp;on when or by who SimpleCart will be adopted, and for now SimpleCart licenses&nbsp;can still be bought via the website, though it no longer includes support or upgrades.
