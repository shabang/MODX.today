	I believe the relaunch and rebranding the FAQ refers to, is the one that happened around the CMS Expo,&nbsp;<a href="http://modx.com/blog/2012/05/17/no-more-hiding-in-plain-sight/">back in May 2012</a>.

        <h2>So why is there so much confusion?</h2>

<p>Well, a search on Google Images for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=modx+logo" target="_blank">MODX Logo</a> may give an idea.&nbsp;</p><p>Over the years, the&nbsp;project has seen many logo variations and they haven't always used the full uppercase name. Especially the old logo from the Evolution days (<a href="http://modx.com/company/blog/2009/06/06/separated-at-birth/" target="_blank">which was eventually&nbsp;discontinued because of striking&nbsp;similarities to another logo</a>) shows why some of the older community members may still prefer the lowercase "modx". "MODx" has also been incredibly popular for a couple of years&nbsp;and many tutorials and blog posts around the web still use that particular capitalisation.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>There is also another reason people use other variations: Code.</p><p>The MODX manager uses <strong>a javascript library</strong> which uses the global variable "<em>MODx</em>", with a lowercase x.
