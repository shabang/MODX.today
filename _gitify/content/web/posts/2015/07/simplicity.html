	While that upload happened, Redactor may have created a new directory to hold the images based on the defined upload path containing placeholders for dynamic paths&nbsp;(like <code style="line-height: 1.6em;">[[+year:tag]]</code>, <code style="line-height: 1.6em;">[[+month:tag]]</code>, <code style="line-height: 1.6em;">[[+username:tag]]</code>, <code style="line-height: 1.6em;">[[+alias:tag]]</code>,&nbsp;<code style="line-height: 1.6em;">[[+parent_alias:tag]]</code> and many&nbsp;more). It also made sure the file name was unique by appending an incrementing number to the file name (e.g. <code style="line-height: 1.6em;">image.jpg</code> becomes <code style="line-height: 1.6em;">image_2.jpg</code> if <code style="line-height: 1.6em;">image.jpg</code> already exists), and because it supports media sources out of the box it may have actually uploaded the image to S3, or Dropbox, or other remote servers.&nbsp;</p><p>
	Maybe you're thinking that's all fine and dandy, but where are the&nbsp;alignment options? Classes? Alt tags?&nbsp;Adding a link? All those options are available once you click the image and hit&nbsp;<em>Edit Image </em>in the image&nbsp;overlay. Some of these features are disabled by default to provide the least intimidating defaults, but with a simple setting change they are ready.&nbsp;</p><p>
