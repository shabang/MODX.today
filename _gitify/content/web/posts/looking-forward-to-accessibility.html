It was 2006 and even back then our professor Chris Rhode had the foresight to see accessibility on the web in the pitiful state it is today. Chris knew we had WYSIWYG apps like Adobe Dreamweaver (actually it was still Macromedia back then) on our lab machines that we all were eager to use. So he had them locked down. We were literally forced to write all our assignments in Notepad or TextEdit. He saw the days of when Web Developers would not author the HTML that governs the experience of their users and he made sure each of his students graduated with a conviction to fight against this sort of progressive decay of the web.\\n\\nChris taught me the most important thing I''ve come to learn about web design. To [start with HTML\u2013first][4]. He made sure that when I entered the industry to build fullscreen highly interactive award\u2013winning Flash sites there would be a fully semantic and accessible HTML underneath them that like the foundation to a building was built first. We learned that JavaScript should only be used to enhance, not author, the DOM that your experience consists of. Chris instilled upon us a sense of ethics. With great power comes great responsibility and as you obtain the power of publishing to the web it is important you architect it ethically so that not just every person but every user can use it.\\n\\nIn 2007 Chris witnessed me design and publish to the homepage of nike.com as an intern. He saw me win a Rosey Award for being on the nike6.com team that same year then win another Rosey Award for leading development on the best site under $50,000 Initial Production the next year. Chris then saw me return to where it all started by returning to the Art Institute of Portland as a Professor in 2009. I returned to teach students the principles he taught me. The students I had a pleasure of instructing there have gone on to build amazing award\u2013winning and accessible experiences as well. I''m absolutely blow away by the experiences they have built upon semantic and accessible HTML. Today I am a Thinkful Mentor and any student I even spend an hour session with comes away knowing that if they don''t architect the web HTML\u2013first I will hunt them down and find them because **I want to be like Chris**. My students will architect the web responsibly, not simply publish to it.\\n\\nAll of these experiences I was part of building were under incredibly tight deadlines and never had accessibility requested by the client, were fully accessible because Chris taught his students to build them in that order. I''ve worked tireless to live out the principles Chris instilled upon me but I fear if he knew my level of involvement in the MODX 2.x project over the past several years he would be surprised by my failure to bring accessibility into the MODX core product or even to the forefront of the process of the core team.\\n\\nI''ve been wanting to [break MODX for everyone][3] since I first discovered MODX 2.0.8 in 2011. I was working for some incredible designers at the time and just like they require control over every pixel of their design I needed control over every character of the website to bring their designs to life. Needless to say, when I discovered how MODX allows you to freely author websites and organize content myself and my Art Director at the time, David Nakamoto, were sold on using it to power our websites.

MODX 2.3 did not make any improvements in the area of responsive design or accessibility, mostly because doing so is infeasible at best. The Manager interface is creating by and governed by an outdated and opinionated JavaScript framework which is short for ExtJS. ExtJS has held the MODX revolution Management back from actualizing the experience it could bring end users. In order to create something truly accessible ExtJS needs to go and the experience needs to be architected HTML\u2013first.

As we enjoyed a few liters at the Beer Garden that evening I found myself thinking there must be something we can do to at least make the default 2.x theme less un\u2013usable. A few days later I submitted a pull request to [make the default 2.x manager theme more mobile friendly][3].
