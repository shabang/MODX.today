More about the Ambassadors Program

Ivan Klimchuk's question: Why is it so important to keep backwards compatibility?
</dt>
  <dd><p>MODX is not "stuck" on 5.2, as it works fine on more recent versions of PHP, but it's good that it does work with older version when working with other systems that may not be up to date, or if the user is not on the latest and greatest hardware/software.</p><p>Semantic versioning is important as it communicates when updates are expected&nbsp;to break behaviour.</p></dd>
