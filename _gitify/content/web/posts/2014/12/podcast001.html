More about the Ambassadors Program
</dt>
  <dd><p>Expecting about 5 or 10 people to join the ambassadors, the initial feedback to the program blew the team away with over 70 ambassadors committing to the new requirements.&nbsp;</p></dd>

  <dd><p>MySQL Cache uses a MySQL table to&nbsp;cache data, instead of putting stuff in the filesystem. The short answer to Christian's questions is no, it does not help performance for simple projects on a single server.&nbsp;</p><p>However it does help when working on a high availability / replicated / load balanced&nbsp;environment with a separate database server, such as the one talked about by Mark Willis at the MODX Weekend.

<dt>&#91;00:43:10&#93;
Ivan Klimchuk's question: Why is it so important to keep backwards compatibility?
</dt>
  <dd><p>MODX is not "stuck" on 5.2, as it works fine on more recent versions of PHP, but it's good that it does work with older version when working with other systems that may not be up to date, or if the user is not on the latest and greatest hardware/software.</p><p>Semantic versioning is important as it communicates when updates are expected&nbsp;to break behaviour.</p></dd>
