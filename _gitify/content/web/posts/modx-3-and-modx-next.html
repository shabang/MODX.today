</p><p>One thing that isn't clear to everyone is the difference between MODX 3 and MODX Next. These terms and numbers aren't new, but they're often confused and shouldn't be considered the same thing.

</p><p><strong>MODX 3 </strong>is the next logical evolution for MODX Revolution.

It's a chance to upgrade MODX to the next level by removing legacy and making things better at the expense of breaking (some) backwards compatibility with MODX 2.

It might just be version 1 of a completely different product.
