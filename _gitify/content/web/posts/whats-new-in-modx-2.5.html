<h2>Improved Accessibility</h2>

<p>JP was the top community&nbsp;contributor for this release, and one of the reasons for that is his quest for a more accessible manager. In 2.5, he has delivered a number of improvements related to accessibility.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>More Mobile Friendly</h2>

<p>And it's not just more accessible, 2.5 is more user-friendly as well, including on mobile devices!&nbsp;The biggest change is that the manager is now sort of responsive. It's still based on ExtJS, but with some clever CSS it's actually much improved.&nbsp;</p><p>Here's some screenshots of what the improved manager on mobile.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="gallery slick-slider slick-centerMode" data-slider="slick" data-options="slide:div;autoplay:false;centerMode:true;centerPadding:16%;">
    
</div>

<h2>Performance Improvements</h2>

<p>One of the most <del>hated </del>disliked features in MODX is probably the dynamic assets minification, controlled by the&nbsp;compress_js and compress_css settings. It was meant to provide a better performance by minifying and compressing assets on the fly, rather than serving dozens of different files. But it was also prone to issues and was often the cause of broken managers.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2.5, this feature has been replaced by a pre-built minified file of all relevant core javascript and css files.

The speed improvement has to do with deep levels of parsing, so the more complex your site build, the more you might benefit from this improvement.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>PHP 7 Compatibility</h2>

<p>Another long-awaited improvement is compatibility with PHP 7. This effort involved several members of the community, Lukas Zahnd being the top contributor in this area, and focused on updating dependencies within MODX that were not compatible, as well as fixing some issues caused by&nbsp;a number of breaking changes in PHP 7.&nbsp;</p><p>There aren't a lot of hosts offering PHP 7 by default yet, but when they do you'll be able of migrating without concern about the MODX core.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Easier CMPs with modParsedManagerController</h2>

<p>Announced at the MODXpo in Munich, Romain contributed (among other things!) a new way to build manager pages in MODX 2.5. This makes use of a new base controller class, the modParsedManagerController, which eases the way you can use simple HTML and MODX tags to build out a component. &nbsp;</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; worth a separate blog post for sure</p>
