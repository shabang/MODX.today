<h2>MODX anatomy</h2>

<h3>Resources</h3>

<p>A resource is a page in MODX. Each resource, like pages and posts in WordPress, has a unique ID. You can find the ID in the resource tree, in parenthesis next to the document name. If you want to link to resource with an ID of 1, you’d use the following:</p>

<pre><code class="language-markup">&lt;a href=&quot;&#91;&#91;~1&#93;&#93;&quot;&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>

<p>You’ve probably noticed the square brackets. That’s MODX syntax. We’ll come back to that.</p><p>Resources have different content types. By default, the content type is set to HTML so it appears as a web page. Other content types include CSS, JavaScript, XML, JSON, etc.</p><p>So, for example, if you wanted to <a href="https://rtfm.modx.com/extras/revo/getresources/getresources.examples/getresources.google-xml-sitemap">create an XML sitemap</a>, you could create a resource, set the content type to XML, give the resource an alias of ‘sitemap’, add a basic loop, and you’re done! MODX will serve up the resource as an XML file.</p>

<h3>Elements</h3>

<p>MODX Elements include Templates, Template Variables, Chunks, Snippets, and Plugins. These are all things that are created in the Manager in the ‘Elements’ tab in the left hand menu. In the following sections, we’ll explore these Elements.</p>

<h3>Templates</h3>

<p>Templates can be applied to a resource and dictate how that resource should look. To create a Template, click the plus icon next to ‘Templates’ in the ‘Elements’ tab.</p><p>The markup of a template is stored in the database by default. If you use version control such as Git, you’ll probably want to use static files. To do this, select the template you want to edit, then select ‘Is Static’ option and navigate to the relevant file.</p><p>Templates can’t contain PHP code; you’ll want to use Snippets for that. While at first this might seem frustrating, the separation of logic and presentation creates easy to read code.</p><p>Here’s what a very basic template in MODX looks like:</p>

<pre><code class="language-markup">&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;&#91;&#91;++site_name&#93;&#93; - &#91;&#91;*pagetitle&#93;&#93;&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;base href=&quot;&#91;&#91;++site_url&#93;&#93;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&#91;&#91;*content&#93;&#93;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>

<p>Nice and clean, huh? It gets better! View it in the browser and you’ll quickly notice there’s no injected code. No emoji JavaScript, no meta tags, or any of the other cruft that WordPress throws in.</p>
