<h2>MODX anatomy</h2>

<h3>Resources</h3>

<p>A resource is a page in MODX. Each resource, like pages and posts in WordPress, has a unique ID. You can find the ID in the resource tree, in parenthesis next to the document name. If you want to link to resource with an ID of 1, you’d use the following:</p><p>&lt;a href="[[~1]]"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;</p><p>You’ve probably noticed the square brackets. That’s MODX syntax. We’ll come back to that.</p><p>Resources have different content types. By default, the content type is set to HTML so it appears as a web page. Other content types include CSS, JavaScript, XML, JSON, etc.</p><p>So, for example, if you wanted to <a href="https://rtfm.modx.com/extras/revo/getresources/getresources.examples/getresources.google-xml-sitemap">create an XML sitemap</a>, you could create a resource, set the content type to XML, give the resource an alias of ‘sitemap’, add a basic loop, and you’re done! MODX will serve up the resource as an XML file.</p>
