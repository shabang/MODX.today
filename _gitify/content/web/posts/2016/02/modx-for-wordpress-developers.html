<h2>MODX anatomy</h2>

<h3>Resources</h3>

<p>A resource is a page in MODX. Each resource, like pages and posts in WordPress, has a unique ID. You can find the ID in the resource tree, in parenthesis next to the document name. If you want to link to resource with an ID of 1, you’d use the following:</p>

<pre><code class="language-markup">&lt;a href=&quot;&#91;&#91;~1&#93;&#93;&quot;&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>

<p>You’ve probably noticed the square brackets. That’s MODX syntax. We’ll come back to that.</p><p>Resources have different content types. By default, the content type is set to HTML so it appears as a web page. Other content types include CSS, JavaScript, XML, JSON, etc.</p><p>So, for example, if you wanted to <a href="https://rtfm.modx.com/extras/revo/getresources/getresources.examples/getresources.google-xml-sitemap">create an XML sitemap</a>, you could create a resource, set the content type to XML, give the resource an alias of ‘sitemap’, add a basic loop, and you’re done! MODX will serve up the resource as an XML file.</p>

<h3>Elements</h3>

<p>MODX Elements include Templates, Template Variables, Chunks, Snippets, and Plugins. These are all things that are created in the Manager in the ‘Elements’ tab in the left hand menu. In the following sections, we’ll explore these Elements.</p>

<h3>Templates</h3>

<p>Templates can be applied to a resource and dictate how that resource should look. To create a Template, click the plus icon next to ‘Templates’ in the ‘Elements’ tab.</p><p>The markup of a template is stored in the database by default. If you use version control such as Git, you’ll probably want to use static files. To do this, select the template you want to edit, then select ‘Is Static’ option and navigate to the relevant file.</p><p>Templates can’t contain PHP code; you’ll want to use Snippets for that. While at first this might seem frustrating, the separation of logic and presentation creates easy to read code.</p><p>Here’s what a very basic template in MODX looks like:</p>

<pre><code class="language-markup">&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;&#91;&#91;++site_name&#93;&#93; - &#91;&#91;*pagetitle&#93;&#93;&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;base href=&quot;&#91;&#91;++site_url&#93;&#93;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&#91;&#91;*content&#93;&#93;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>

<p>Nice and clean, huh? It gets better! View it in the browser and you’ll quickly notice there’s no injected code. No emoji JavaScript, no meta tags, or any of the other cruft that WordPress throws in.</p>

<h3>Template Variables</h3>

<p>Template Variables or "TVs" are the equivalent to WordPress custom fields. A TV is tied to a template (or multiple templates). And, like WordPress, you can change the input type to text, image, select, checkbox, date, etc.</p><p>To output a TV, you’d use:</p>

<pre><code class="language-markup">&#91;&#91;*name-of-tv&#93;&#93;</code></pre>

<h3>Chunks</h3>

<p>Chunks are reusable HTML markup (i.e. header, footer, sidebar, etc.). This is similar to using `get_template_part` or `include` in WordPress, except chunks can’t contain PHP.</p><p>To call a chunk:</p>

<pre><code class="language-markup">&#91;&#91;$name-of-chunk&#93;&#93;</code></pre>

<h3>Snippets</h3>

<p>Snippets are dynamic bits of PHP code. They operate like PHP functions in that you can pass properties to them.</p><p>Here’s a basic example of a snippet:</p>

<pre><code class="language-php">&lt;?php
$person = 'World';

if(!empty($name)){
	$person = $name;
}

return &quot;Hello {$person}!&quot;;</code></pre>

<p>And you can call it like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-markup">&#91;&#91;helloWorld&#93;&#93;
&#91;&#91;helloWorld? &amp;name=`Marc`&#93;&#93;</code></pre>

<p>Which would output:</p>

<pre><code class="language-markup">Hello World!
​Hello Marc!</code></pre>

<h3>Plugins</h3>

<p>Plugins, like Snippets, are bits of PHP code that have access to the MODX API. The difference is when the code executes. Snippets sit inside a template and run when the page is viewed. Plugins execute during certain system events (such as clearing the cache or saving a document).</p>

<h3>Tag syntax</h3>

<p>Here’s a quick reference of the MODX tag syntax:</p><p><strong>Resource Fields - [[*field:tag]]</strong><br>These are fields that are pulled from the current document, such as [[*pagetitle]] and [[*content]].</p><p>Template Variables - [[*name-of-tv:tag]]<br>TVs are custom fields, again pulled from the current document.</p><p>Chunks - [[$name-of-chunk:tag]]<br>Reusable HTML markup - think headers, footers, sidebars, or other common components.</p><p>Snippets - [[snippet:tag]]<br>Dynamic bits of PHP.</p><p>Placeholders - [[+placeholder:tag]]</p><p>Placeholders are typically used with snippets such as getResources to get another document’s resource field, however placeholders can be set to any value. Check out <a href="https://www.markhamstra.com/modx/2012/2/placeholders-resource-fields-tags/">Mark’s article</a> for a more detailed explanation of the difference between placeholders and resource fields.</p><p>Links - [[~1]]</p><p>Generates a link to the resource. Replace 1 with the ID of the resource you want to link to.</p><p>System Settings - [[++system_setting]]</p><p>These are settings that are configurable in the Manager.</p><p><br>Comments - [[- My comment. ]]Since you can’t use PHP in templates (with a Snippet), you’ll want to use this syntax if you want to remove your comments from the output.</p>

<p><strong>Resource Fields - [[*field:tag]]</strong></p>
<p>These are fields that are pulled from the current document, such as [[*pagetitle:tag]] and [[*content:tag]].</p>
