introtext: '<a href="https://modx.today/posts/2016/11/critical-security-update-available-modx-2.5.2">A few weeks ago MODX Revolution 2.5.2 was released</a>, fixing a critical security vulnerability. As not everyone is able of instantly updating their sites, Johan van der Molen at Sterc prepared patches for older MODX versions, as far back as 2.3.3. These are now available to the community to help secure their websites. '
