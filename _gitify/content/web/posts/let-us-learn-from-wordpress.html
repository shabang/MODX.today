MODX is considered by many to be the best suited system to create responsive and accessible web experiences.

Their Dashboard is mobile friendly, works without JavaScript enabled, and uses accessible icons. So what is so significant about their recent announcement? By [requiring WCAG 2.0 at level AA Guidelines for any updates][1] Wordpress has drawn a line in the sand. They have made a clear and concise commitment to the World Wide Web. They aren''t just striving for accessibility \u2014 they are requiring it. This means that new additions to the core software *must* meet the WCAG guidelines or they will not be accepted into the core.\\n\\nOne can safely assume Wordpress is willing to make this commitment with the realization that accessible software is better for everyone. They may loose out on or prolong the adoption of highly anticipated features but they must rest easy knowing they ship inclusive software. Publishing to the web is the ability to share your expressions, passions, and thoughts with the world. The ability to be heard, seen, understood, and followed is a right \u2014 not a privilege.

Wordpress officially commits to the WCAG Guidelines Level AA for their core and anything bundled with the product. With the exception of addressing color contrast ratios in a separate theme, MODX does not commit to WCAG Guidelines of any level. MODX does not commit \u2013 beyond hope \u2013 to improving accessibility in its own[[$nbsp]]core. Wordpress supports people by committing to directly improve accessibility in future updates of their core products. MODX supports particular[[$nbsp]]users by providing a bolt&ndash;on theme that does not ship with the core[[$nbsp]]product.\\n\\n## Make Clear & Concise Commitments\\n[Hope is not enough](https:\/\/github.com\/modxcms\/a11y\/issues\/64#issuecomment-163765181).

This causes confusion and leaves contributors unsure if they should submit pull requests to the core, the a11y theme, or neither.
