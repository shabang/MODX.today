Leading the industry in creative freedom, MODX is considered by many to be the best suited system to create responsive and accessible web experiences. But the web shouldn''t just be something anyone can browse &mdash; it should be something anyone can author as well.\\n\\nOn March 21st the Wordpress team made an incredible announcement that will make the web a more inclusive place to author.\\n\\n> All new or updated code released into WordPress core and bundled themes must conform with the WCAG 2.0 guidelines at level AA.\\n\\nThe Wordpress project has taken accessibility seriously for years. Their Dashboard is mobile friendly, works without JavaScript enabled, and uses accessible icons. So what is so significant about their recent announcement? By [requiring WCAG 2.0 AA Guidelines for any updates][1] Wordpress has drawn a line in the sand. They have made a clear and concise commitment to the greater World Wide Web. They aren''t just striving for accessibility &mdash; they are requiring accessibility. This means that new additions to the core software *must* meet the WCAG guidelines or they will not be accepted into the core. No exceptions.\\n\\nOne can safely assume Wordpress is willing to make this commitment because they have realized that accessible software is better for everyone. They may loose out on or prolong the adoption of shiny new features until they meet accessibility requirements but they must rest easy knowing they ship software that is [better for everyone][2]. Publishing to the web is the ability to share your expressions, passions, and thoughts with the world. The ability to be heard, seen, understood, and followed is a right &mdash; not a privilege. Unfortunately, [the web isn''t always built this way][3]. We can do better. But how?\\n\\n## Making Clear & Concise Commitments\\nThe MODX waters have become murky with hopes empty promises. We are left thirsty for clear and concise commitments. We cannot confidently determine where to direct our efforts most effectively. For example, when improvements to the MODX core are submitted they are by nature incompatible with the separate theme lead by the MODX Accessibility Campaign. It pains me to think that enhancements that make MODX more accessible on small viewports [hopefully will be accessible to everyone](https:\/\/github.com\/modxcms\/a11y\/issues\/64#issuecomment-163765181).\\n\\n> Hi JP \u2026 it''s very much in line with what''s going on with a11y. Much, if not all, of the work done on the a11y theme will hopefully become part of the core\/default theme.\\n&mdash; [@rthrash](https:\/\/github.com\/modxcms\/a11y\/issues\/64#issuecomment-163765181)\\n\\nHope is not enough. There is [no room for segregation][6] of access in an open project. Enforcement is necessary. In America we don''t hope buildings are wheelchair accessible. We require it. No exceptions. There is no official commitment that Pull Requests that make the MODX core more accessible will wind up in the a11y theme. Likewise, there is no official commitment that improvements made in the a11y theme will work their way back into the MODX core. We have [issues with labels](https:\/\/github.com\/modxcms\/a11y\/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22port+to+revo%2Fcore%22) and hopes. [Issues labeled Port to Revo][4] are closed regardless of if they have actually been ported to Revo. This causes confusion and leaves contributors unsure if they should submit Pull Requests to the core, the a11y theme, or neither. Rather than committing to globally adopted guidelines MODX LLC is working towards checking items of a tasks list provided by their largest campaign contributor. Accessibility is not for sale. As a open source project we must come together and commit to globally adopted standards &mdash; not sell out to the highest bidder. No exceptions.\\n\\n## Support People Not Users\\nThere are people and there are users. Any given person can be a number of users throughout the day. Heading to lunch? As you switch from your broadband and keyboard enabled desktop to a mobile phone you are the same person \u2013 yet you have become an entirely different user. Can you use keyboard shortcuts? Can you save a file to your desktop? Can you gobble up all the bits you please or is your bandwidth capped by a monthly data allowance? Investing time, money, and efforts in the misconception that there are normal people and then there are people with disabilities is ignorant at best. [Accessible software is better for everyone][3], not just a targeted group.\\n\\nThe MODX Accessibility Campaign commits to helping particular users of a particular theme &mdash; not people. [Web accessibility means that people can use the web][2] &mdash; not particular users. We must learn from Wordpress and **put the notion that assistive technology is only applicable to a particular group to rest**. Let us adopt [guidelines that do just that][5]. Let us work towards a web all people can author with MODX regardless of where MODX LLC directs their internal efforts.\\n\\n## Break It\\nThe MODX 2.x Dashboard was not designed to be inclusive. You''ll hear no argument from me that it should have been either. Let me explain. When I first discovered MODX 2.0.8 I assumed it was software lead by a team of dozens of developers who focused full&ndash;time on the product. That is not and never has been the case. To this day, MODX 2.x leads the industry in the areas it has focused on. It is nothing sort of spectacular. Jason Coward and Shaun McCormick, along with a small group of contributors, managed to create something truly brilliant with a fraction of the resources necessary to do so.\\n\\nBy any reasonable measure MODX Revolution should be considered a success in every way. But I''m sick of being reasonable. Aren''t you? It is time we face another impossible challenge. Let us enable anyone to author the web with MODX. Let us reimagine the Manager interface from the ground up. Let us commit clearly and concisely that in a future major version (MODX Next) the core must commit to respecting the WCAG Guidelines. Let us join Wordpress in the commitment to make authoring the web more inclusive for everyone. Let us learn from Wordpress.\\n\\n## Establish a Code of Conduct\\nAs a passionate and outspoken contributor you might think I''d be opposed to establishing a strict code of conduct. That is not the case. I believe MODX needs a Code of Conduct and it should apply to everyone. [Wordpress has a Code of Conduct][7] that we could all learn from. Inclusiveness isn''t just about assistive technology that allows anyone to use and author the web. We also need to work towards ensuring the MODX project is a safe place to contribute.\\n\\nOver the past 5 years I have worn several hats. I''ve gone from a MODX site builder, to a contributor, to contracting for the LLC, to being involved with mod**more**, to working full&ndash;time for MODX LLC. I''ve had the opportunity to view this thing we love from a number of vantage points. I''ve experienced comradery and productive team work. I''ve been a part of creating amazing things.\\n\\nI''ve also been blatantly lied to, literally stolen from, and had significant efforts mocked and belittled without any sort of justification or constructive criticism. Of course none of this I experienced from the community but from the Limited Liability Corporation that should be setting an example for the community it depends upon. I''ve been called an idiot by sitting members of the core team for suggesting the Accessibility Campaign isn''t inclusive to all people and in the same breathe been told that I only contribute to the MODX project for attention. It''s a wonder I hang around. Frankly, I wouldn''t expect any other contributor to stay part of the community after the things I''ve experienced. I do so not just for my love of the product, but my lasting conviction that MODX is destined to be a pen anyone can grip to author their story and share it across the www. Before we break ground on breaking changes we need to shift some focus from our codebase to our conduct&ndash;base. A code of conduct is absolutely something that should be drafted, revised, and submitted by the community. Let us learn from Wordpress and make sure our community as well as our software is inclusive for everyone. We need a Code of Conduct that welcomes all the help we can get to make MODX Next a reality.\\n\\n\",\"field\":15,\"settings\":[]}]},\"settings\":[],\"parent\":0,\"title\":\"\"}]","linear":[{"value":"[1]:https:\/\/make.wordpress.org\/accessibility\/2016\/03\/21\/wordpress-goes-wcag\/\n[2]:http:\/\/alistapart.com\/article\/reframing-accessibility-for-the-web\n[3]:http:\/\/mrmrs.io\/writing\/2016\/03\/23\/the-veil-of-ignorance\/\n[4]:https:\/\/github.com\/modxcms\/a11y\/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22port+to+revo%2Fcore%22\n[5]:https:\/\/github.com\/jpdevries\/webguidelines#preface\n[6]:https:\/\/github.com\/modxcms\/revolution\/issues\/12782\n[7]:https:\/\/make.wordpress.org\/community\/handbook\/wordcamp-organizer-handbook\/planning-details\/code-of-conduct\/\n\nMODX gives creative freedom to site builders allowing them to control each character of the markup delivered to their audience.
