Leading the industry in creative freedom, MODX is considered by many to be the best suited system to create responsive and accessible web experiences. But the web shouldn''t just be something anyone can browse &mdash; it should be something anyone can author as[[$nbsp]]well.\\n\\nOn March 21st the Wordpress team made an incredible announcement that will make the web a more inclusive place to[[$nbsp]]author.\\n\\n> All new or updated code released into WordPress core and bundled themes must conform with the WCAG 2.0 guidelines at level AA.\\n\\nThe Wordpress project has taken accessibility seriously for years. Their Dashboard is mobile friendly, works without JavaScript enabled, and uses accessible icons. So what is so significant about their recent announcement? By [requiring WCAG 2.0 at level AA Guidelines for any updates][1] Wordpress has drawn a line in the sand. They have made a clear and concise commitment to the World Wide Web. They aren''t just striving for accessibility &mdash; they are requiring it. This means that new additions to the core software *must* meet the WCAG guidelines or they will not be accepted into the core. No[[$nbsp]]exceptions.\\n\\nOne can safely assume Wordpress is willing to make this commitment because they have realized that accessible software is better for everyone. They may loose out on or prolong the adoption of shiny new features until they meet accessibility requirements but they must rest easy knowing they ship inclusive software. Publishing to the web is the ability to share your expressions, passions, and thoughts with the world. The ability to be heard, seen, understood, and followed is a right &mdash; not a privilege. Unfortunately, [the web isn''t always built this way][3]. We can do better. But[[$nbsp]]how?\\n\\n## TL;DR\\n - With a single sentence Wordpress makes a clear and concise commitment that leave no room for speculation as to how accessibility is treated in their core software &mdash; with an entire campaign MODX does[[$nbsp]]not.\\n - Wordpress officially commits to the WCAG Guidelines Level AA for their core and anything bundled with the product. With the exception of color contrast ratios, MODX does not commit to WCAG Guidelines of any level.\\n - MODX does not commit &ndash; beyond hope &ndash; to improving accessibility in its own[[$nbsp]]core.\\n - Wordpress commits to directly improving accessibility through future updates of their core products. MODX does[[$nbsp]]not. The Accessibility Campaign targets 2.3 which was released July[[$nbsp]]16,[[$nbsp]]2014.\\n - Wordpress Accessibility supports people. MODX Accessibility supports particular[[$nbsp]]users.\\n - MODX stereotypically segregates users.\\n - Wordpress has a Code of Conduct &mdash; MODX does[[$nbsp]]not.\\n\\n## Make Clear & Concise Commitments\\nThe MODX waters have become murky. We are left [thirsty for clear and concise commitments][12] that make accessibility part of our underlying process rather than attempting to bolt it on. Contributors cannot confidently determine where to direct their efforts most effectively. When improvements to the MODX core are submitted they are not necessarily compatible with separate themes. It pains me to think that enhancements that make the MODX core more accessible [hopefully will be accessible to[[$nbsp]]a11y theme users](https:\/\/github.com\/modxcms\/a11y\/issues\/64#issuecomment-163765181). And vice&ndash;versa.\\n\\n> Hi JP \u2026 it''s very much in line with what''s going on with a11y. Much, if not all, of the work done on the a11y theme will hopefully become part of the core\/default theme.\\n&mdash; [@rthrash](https:\/\/github.com\/modxcms\/a11y\/issues\/64#issuecomment-163765181)\\n\\nHope is not enough. There is no official commitment that pull requests which make the MODX core more accessible will wind up in the a11y theme. Likewise, there is no official commitment that improvements made in the a11y theme will work their way back into the MODX core. We have [issues with labels](https:\/\/github.com\/modxcms\/a11y\/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22port+to+revo%2Fcore%22) and hopes. [Issues labeled Port to Revo][4] are closed regardless of if they have actually been ported to Revo. Accessibility issues at the Revolution GitHub repository are closed without being address in the core. This causes confusion and leaves contributors unsure if they should submit pull requests to the core, the a11y theme, or neither. Rather than committing to globally adopted guidelines MODX LLC is working towards checking items of a tasks list provided by their largest campaign contributor. As an open source project we must come together and commit to globally adopted standards &mdash; not sell out to the highest[[$nbsp]]bidder.\\n\\nThe LLC will do as the LLC does. And so it is and so it goes. Fortunately the MODX Community is free to choose a wiser and more inclusive path to just access for all[[$nbsp]]people. We don''t need to crowd-raise thousands of dollars or tinker with previous releases and bolt&ndash;on themes. We need to take a look at how the rest of the industry solves these[[$nbsp]]problems and integrate them into directly the core of future[[$nbsp]]releases.\\n\\n## Support People Not Users\\nThere are people and there are users. Any given person can be a number of users throughout the day. Heading to lunch? As you switch from your broadband and keyboard enabled desktop to a mobile phone you are the same person \u2013 yet you have become an entirely different user. Can you use keyboard shortcuts? Can you save a file to your desktop? Can you gobble up all the bits you please or is your bandwidth capped by a monthly data allowance? Your abilities are not just relative to your person they are also relative to the devices you access experiences through. Investing time, money, and efforts in the misconception that there are normal people and then there are people with disabilities is ignorant at best. [Accessible software is better for everyone][3], not just a targeted[[$nbsp]]group.\\n\\n> The final result will be a new Manager Theme you can install in MODX 2.3 or later. A simple change of your Manager Theme setting will enable anyone to use MODX to create and manage sites in an accessible CMS.\\n&emsp;&mdash;&emsp;[a11y.modx.com][9]\\n\\nEnable anyone to use MODX? No it won''t. What if I''m on a touch device, mobile device, or one of the [users that don''t receive JavaScript][13] even though it is enabled? What if I can''t navigate to the Package Manager to install the opt&ndash;in theme in the first[[$nbsp]]place? You can hack ARIA roles until you are blue in the face but you cannot skip over HTML in your development process and simultaneously support anyone and[[$nbsp]]everyone. [The web is for everyone][14] and it was designed to be built atop HTML for this very[[$nbsp]]reason.\\n\\nThe MODX Accessibility Campaign commits to helping particular users of a particular theme &mdash; not people. When you use a device that is keyboard and screen reader enabled the a11y theme is very useful. Otherwise, even though you are the same person, it is no longer as useful. To date, if you are using a small viewport the a11y theme isn''t navigable at all. The MODX 2.5 prerelease however is much [improved in this area][11]. To whom does this separation[[$nbsp]]serve?\\n\\n[Web accessibility means that people can use the web][2] &mdash; not particular users. We must learn from Wordpress and **put the notion that assistive technology is only applicable to a particular group to rest**. Let us adopt [guidelines that do just that][5]. Let us work towards a web all people can author with MODX regardless of where MODX LLC directs their internal[[$nbsp]]efforts.\\n\\n## Stop Segregating People\\nLet''s look at the call for action found at [a11y.modx.com][9] which links to [this post][2].\\n\\n> It\u2019s time to act now and right that wrong! Making an accessible MODX CMS Manager is the right thing\u2014[for everybody][2], but we need your help to complete this huge task.\\n\\nOk. Cool. Let''s look at the definition of[[$nbsp]]everybody:\\n\\n> Every person; everyone.\\n\\nOnly certain people will install an opt&ndash;in theme that does not ship with the core product.\\nTo claim that an opt&ndash;in theme will support *everybody* is literally nonsense. The only way to support everybody is to start with HTML and bake accessibility into your product. No exceptions. [Anything else is prejudicial[[$nbsp]]segregation][10].\\n\\n> When we hold a prejudicial view toward a group we are not members of, we tend to see \u201cthem\u201d as more alike than the groups we are in. In other words, we see the groups that \u201cwe\u201d belong to as full of diverse individuals, but \u201cthey\u201d are all alike. This is called out-group homogeneity.  \\n&emsp;&mdash;&emsp;[A List Apart][2]\\n\\n## Group Meetings\\nWordpress contributors join one or more of the following groups that meet on a weekly[[$nbsp]]basis:\\n\\n - [Core](http:\/\/make.wordpress.org\/core\/)\\n - [Design](http:\/\/make.wordpress.org\/design\/)\\n - [Mobile](http:\/\/make.wordpress.org\/mobile\/)\\n - [Accessibility](http:\/\/make.wordpress.org\/accessibility\/)\\n - [Polygots](http:\/\/make.wordpress.org\/polyglots\/)\\n - [Support](http:\/\/make.wordpress.org\/support\/)\\n - [Themes](http:\/\/make.wordpress.org\/themes\/)\\n - [Documentation](http:\/\/make.wordpress.org\/docs\/)\\n - [Community](http:\/\/make.wordpress.org\/community\/)\\n - [Plugins](http:\/\/make.wordpress.org\/plugins\/)\\n - [Training](http:\/\/make.wordpress.org\/training\/)\\n - [Meta](http:\/\/make.wordpress.org\/meta\/)\\n - [TV](http:\/\/make.wordpress.org\/tv\/)\\n - [Flow](http:\/\/make.wordpress.org\/flow\/)\\n\\nIn some respects the MODX project already does this. We have a variety of Slack channels that community members can join to follow or discuss particular topics. We have RTFM which anyone can request privileges to edit. Twitter, Slack, and the Forums cover community driven support. There are a number of community initiatives and web sites dedicated to MODX training, plugins, and even[[$nbsp]]themes.\\n\\nOne area we are lacking is the weekly meetings and the resources that surround[[$nbsp]]them. Should MODX move towards a model of open governance perhaps groups that meet periodically would be of[[$nbsp]]benefit.\\n\\n## [MODX] Next Please\\nThe MODX 2.x Dashboard was not designed to be inclusive. You''ll hear no argument from me that it should have been either. [Let me explain][8]. When I first discovered MODX 2.0.8 I assumed it was software lead by a team of dozens of developers who focused full&ndash;time on the product. That is not and never has been the case. To this day, MODX 2.x leads the industry in the areas it has focused on. It is nothing sort of spectacular. Jason Coward and Shaun McCormick, along with a small group of contributors, managed to create something truly brilliant with a fraction of the resources necessary to do[[$nbsp]]so.\\n\\nBy any reasonable measure MODX Revolution should be considered a complete success. But I''m sick of being reasonable. Aren''t you? It is time we face another defining challenge. Let us enable anyone to author the web with MODX. Let us reimagine the Manager interface from the ground up. Let us commit clearly and concisely that in a future major version (MODX Next) the core must commit to respecting the WCAG Guidelines. No exceptions. Let us join Wordpress in the commitment to make authoring the web inclusive for[[$nbsp]]everyone. Let us do so directly in future updates to our software rather than indirectly in stale releases. Let us learn from[[$nbsp]]Wordpress.\\n\\n## Keep Your Word\\nThe MODX Accessibility campaign pledged that updates would appear at [a11y.modx.com][9], the blog, as well in the email newsletter. Let''s look at the first update published February[[$nbsp]]24,[[$nbsp]]2015.\\n\\n> We launched our [fundraising campaign to make the MODX Revolution Manager accessible](https:\/\/a11y.modx.com\/) just over a week ago. Since then, we\u2019ve had a wonderful response, with generous donors from around the world. To date we\u2019ve raised a $29,648 including the $25,000 from The Ohio State University\u2014just shy of 60% of our goal! The other comes from:  \\n<br>76 awesome MODX Community members\\nEach contributing an average of $57\\nThree individuals generously gave $500\\nEight others showed a big thumbs-up with $100\\n43% of supporters have made contributions of $25\\n\\nThe update covers the launch of the campaign, how many people donated, and how much had been raised. And that''s it. There has yet to be another update. The campaign has raised $12,180 since publishing the first and only update. Prior to MODXpo 2015 I formally requested another update be made. Apparently they haven''t gotten around to it yet. MODX LLC &mdash; If you are going to make a commitment to keep paying contributors informed &mdash; keep them[[$nbsp]]informed. At least hold yourself liable to your own commitments. Judging by the three channels expected to be kept up to date one is left to assume that since February of last year no progress has been made. I''m not going to point out how we could learn from Wordpress here because we don''t need to. This is simply a case of poor[[$nbsp]]communication.\\n\\n## Establish a Code of Conduct\\nAs a passionate and outspoken community member you might think I''d be opposed to establishing a strict code of conduct. That is not the case. I believe MODX needs a Code of Conduct and it should apply to everyone. [Wordpress has a Code of Conduct][7] that we could all learn from. Inclusiveness isn''t just about assistive technology that allows anyone to use and author the web. We also need to work towards ensuring the MODX project is a safe place for anyone to[[$nbsp]]contribute.\\n\\nOver the past 5 years I have worn several hats. I''ve gone from a MODX site builder, to a contributor, to contracting for the LLC, to being involved with mod**more**, to working full&ndash;time for MODX LLC and back again. I''ve had the opportunity to view this thing we love from a number of vantage points. I''ve experienced comradery and productive team work. I''ve been a part of creating amazing[[$nbsp]]things.\\n\\nI''ve also been blatantly lied to, stolen from, and had significant efforts mocked and belittled behind closed doors without any sort of rational justification or constructive criticism. I''ve listened to contributors character &ndash; not their work &ndash; belittled behind their backs for nothing other than pouring their themselves into the project. I''ve been called an idiot by a member of the core team for expressing concerns that the Accessibility Campaign isn''t inclusive to all people and doesn''t pledge to commit back to the core. In the next breathe I was told that I only contribute to the MODX project for attention. All this from the Limited Liability Corporation that should be setting an example for the community it depends upon.\\n\\nNow all of these things happened in the past. Some more recently than others. They are by no means indicative of future behavior. I know MODX is greater than the sum of its parts. I know MODX can evolve. I am grateful to wake each day to this realization but frankly I wouldn''t expect any other contributor to stick around after the things I''ve experienced. I do so not for my love of the product but in light of my lasting conviction that MODX is destined to be an instrument anyone can use to author their story their way and share it across the www. No[[$nbsp]]exceptions.\\n\\nBefore we break ground on MODX Next we need to shift some focus from our codebase to our conduct&ndash;base. A code of conduct is absolutely something that should be drafted, revised, and submitted by the community. Let us learn from Wordpress and make sure our community as well as our software is inclusive for[[$nbsp]]everyone. We need a Code of Conduct that welcomes all the help we can get to make MODX Next a[[$nbsp]]reality.\\n\\n\",\"field\":15,\"settings\":[]}]},\"settings\":[],\"parent\":0,\"title\":\"\"}]","linear":[{"value":"[1]:https:\/\/make.wordpress.org\/accessibility\/2016\/03\/21\/wordpress-goes-wcag\/\n[2]:http:\/\/alistapart.com\/article\/reframing-accessibility-for-the-web\n[3]:http:\/\/mrmrs.io\/writing\/2016\/03\/23\/the-veil-of-ignorance\/\n[4]:https:\/\/github.com\/modxcms\/a11y\/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22port+to+revo%2Fcore%22\n[5]:https:\/\/github.com\/jpdevries\/webguidelines#preface\n[6]:https:\/\/github.com\/modxcms\/revolution\/issues\/12782\n[7]:https:\/\/make.wordpress.org\/community\/handbook\/wordcamp-organizer-handbook\/planning-details\/code-of-conduct\/\n[8]: https:\/\/modx.today\/posts\/2015\/06\/breaking-modx-for-everyone\n[9]:http:\/\/a11y.modx.com\n[10]:http:\/\/alistapart.com\/article\/reframing-accessibility-for-the-web#section1\n[11]:https:\/\/github.com\/modxcms\/revolution\/pull\/12776\n[12]:https:\/\/modx.today\/posts\/2016\/02\/accessibility-is-water\n[13]:https:\/\/gds.blog.gov.uk\/2013\/10\/21\/how-many-people-are-missing-out-on-javascript-enhancement\/\n[14]:http:\/\/www.pocket-lint.com\/news\/116474-sir-tim-berners-lee-olympic-tweet\n\n\nMODX gives creative freedom to site builders allowing them to control each character of the markup delivered to their audience.

Let''s look at the first update published February[[$nbsp]]24,[[$nbsp]]2015.\n\n> We launched our [fundraising campaign to make the MODX Revolution Manager accessible](https:\/\/a11y.modx.com\/) just over a week ago. Since then, we\u2019ve had a wonderful response, with generous donors from around the world. To date we\u2019ve raised a $29,648 including the $25,000 from The Ohio State University\u2014just shy of 60% of our goal! The other comes from:  \n<br>76 awesome MODX Community members\nEach contributing an average of $57\nThree individuals generously gave $500\nEight others showed a big thumbs-up with $100\n43% of supporters have made contributions of $25\n\nThe update covers the launch of the campaign, how many people donated, and how much had been raised. And that''s it. There has yet to be another update. The campaign has raised $12,180 since publishing the first and only update. Prior to MODXpo 2015 I formally requested another update be made. Apparently they haven''t gotten around to it yet. MODX LLC &mdash; If you are going to make a commitment to keep paying contributors informed &mdash; keep them[[$nbsp]]informed. At least hold yourself liable to your own commitments. Judging by the three channels expected to be kept up to date one is left to assume that since February of last year no progress has been made. I''m not going to point out how we could learn from Wordpress here because we don''t need to. This is simply a case of poor[[$nbsp]]communication.\n\n## Establish a Code of Conduct\nAs a passionate and outspoken community member you might think I''d be opposed to establishing a strict code of conduct. That is not the case. I believe MODX needs a Code of Conduct and it should apply to everyone. [Wordpress has a Code of Conduct][7] that we could all learn from. Inclusiveness isn''t just about assistive technology that allows anyone to use and author the web. We also need to work towards ensuring the MODX project is a safe place for anyone to[[$nbsp]]contribute.\n\nOver the past 5 years I have worn several hats. I''ve gone from a MODX site builder, to a contributor, to contracting for the LLC, to being involved with mod**more**, to working full&ndash;time for MODX LLC and back again. I''ve had the opportunity to view this thing we love from a number of vantage points. I''ve experienced comradery and productive team work. I''ve been a part of creating amazing[[$nbsp]]things.\n\nI''ve also been blatantly lied to, stolen from, and had significant efforts mocked and belittled behind closed doors without any sort of rational justification or constructive criticism. I''ve listened to contributors character &ndash; not their work &ndash; belittled behind their backs for nothing other than pouring their themselves into the project. I''ve been called an idiot by a member of the core team for expressing concerns that the Accessibility Campaign isn''t inclusive to all people and doesn''t pledge to commit back to the core. In the next breathe I was told that I only contribute to the MODX project for attention. All this from the Limited Liability Corporation that should be setting an example for the community it depends upon.\n\nNow all of these things happened in the past. Some more recently than others. They are by no means indicative of future behavior. I know MODX is greater than the sum of its parts. I know MODX can evolve. I am grateful to wake each day to this realization but frankly I wouldn''t expect any other contributor to stick around after the things I''ve experienced. I do so not for my love of the product but in light of my lasting conviction that MODX is destined to be an instrument anyone can use to author their story their way and share it across the www. No[[$nbsp]]exceptions.\n\nBefore we break ground on MODX Next we need to shift some focus from our codebase to our conduct&ndash;base. A code of conduct is absolutely something that should be drafted, revised, and submitted by the community. Let us learn from Wordpress and make sure our community as well as our software is inclusive for[[$nbsp]]everyone. We need a Code of Conduct that welcomes all the help we can get to make MODX Next a[[$nbsp]]reality.\n\n","field":15,"settings":[]}],"fieldcounts":{"15":1},"_isContentBlocks":true}}'

        <p>MODX gives creative freedom to site builders allowing them to control each character of the markup delivered to their audience. Leading the industry in creative freedom, MODX is considered by many to be the best suited system to create responsive and accessible web experiences. But the web shouldn't just be something anyone can browse &mdash; it should be something anyone can author as[[$nbsp]]well.</p>
<p>On March 21st the Wordpress team made an incredible announcement that will make the web a more inclusive place to[[$nbsp]]author.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All new or updated code released into WordPress core and bundled themes must conform with the WCAG 2.0 guidelines at level AA.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Wordpress project has taken accessibility seriously for years. Their Dashboard is mobile friendly, works without JavaScript enabled, and uses accessible icons. So what is so significant about their recent announcement? By <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/2016/03/21/wordpress-goes-wcag/">requiring WCAG 2.0 at level AA Guidelines for any updates</a> Wordpress has drawn a line in the sand. They have made a clear and concise commitment to the World Wide Web. They aren't just striving for accessibility &mdash; they are requiring it. This means that new additions to the core software <em>must</em> meet the WCAG guidelines or they will not be accepted into the core. No[[$nbsp]]exceptions.</p>
<p>One can safely assume Wordpress is willing to make this commitment because they have realized that accessible software is better for everyone. They may loose out on or prolong the adoption of shiny new features until they meet accessibility requirements but they must rest easy knowing they ship inclusive software. Publishing to the web is the ability to share your expressions, passions, and thoughts with the world. The ability to be heard, seen, understood, and followed is a right &mdash; not a privilege. Unfortunately, <a href="http://mrmrs.io/writing/2016/03/23/the-veil-of-ignorance/">the web isn't always built this way</a>. We can do better. But[[$nbsp]]how?</p>
<h2>TL;DR</h2>
<ul>
<li>With a single sentence Wordpress makes a clear and concise commitment that leave no room for speculation as to how accessibility is treated in their core software &mdash; with an entire campaign MODX does[[$nbsp]]not.</li>
<li>Wordpress officially commits to the WCAG Guidelines Level AA for their core and anything bundled with the product. With the exception of color contrast ratios, MODX does not commit to WCAG Guidelines of any level.</li>
<li>MODX does not commit &ndash; beyond hope &ndash; to improving accessibility in its own[[$nbsp]]core.</li>
<li>Wordpress commits to directly improving accessibility through future updates of their core products. MODX does[[$nbsp]]not. The Accessibility Campaign targets 2.3 which was released July[[$nbsp]]16,[[$nbsp]]2014.</li>
<li>Wordpress Accessibility supports people. MODX Accessibility supports particular[[$nbsp]]users.</li>
<li>MODX stereotypically segregates users.</li>
<li>Wordpress has a Code of Conduct &mdash; MODX does[[$nbsp]]not.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Make Clear &amp; Concise Commitments</h2>
<p>The MODX waters have become murky. We are left <a href="https://modx.today/posts/2016/02/accessibility-is-water">thirsty for clear and concise commitments</a> that make accessibility part of our underlying process rather than attempting to bolt it on. Contributors cannot confidently determine where to direct their efforts most effectively. When improvements to the MODX core are submitted they are not necessarily compatible with separate themes. It pains me to think that enhancements that make the MODX core more accessible <a href="https://github.com/modxcms/a11y/issues/64#issuecomment-163765181">hopefully will be accessible to[[$nbsp]]a11y theme users</a>. And vice&ndash;versa.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi JP … it's very much in line with what's going on with a11y. Much, if not all, of the work done on the a11y theme will hopefully become part of the core/default theme.
&mdash; <a href="https://github.com/modxcms/a11y/issues/64#issuecomment-163765181">@rthrash</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hope is not enough. There is no official commitment that pull requests which make the MODX core more accessible will wind up in the a11y theme. Likewise, there is no official commitment that improvements made in the a11y theme will work their way back into the MODX core. We have <a href="https://github.com/modxcms/a11y/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22port+to+revo%2Fcore%22">issues with labels</a> and hopes. <a href="https://github.com/modxcms/a11y/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22port+to+revo%2Fcore%22">Issues labeled Port to Revo</a> are closed regardless of if they have actually been ported to Revo. Accessibility issues at the Revolution GitHub repository are closed without being address in the core. This causes confusion and leaves contributors unsure if they should submit pull requests to the core, the a11y theme, or neither. Rather than committing to globally adopted guidelines MODX LLC is working towards checking items of a tasks list provided by their largest campaign contributor. As an open source project we must come together and commit to globally adopted standards &mdash; not sell out to the highest[[$nbsp]]bidder.</p>
<p>The LLC will do as the LLC does. And so it is and so it goes. Fortunately the MODX Community is free to choose a wiser and more inclusive path to just access for all[[$nbsp]]people. We don't need to crowd-raise thousands of dollars or tinker with previous releases and bolt&ndash;on themes. We need to take a look at how the rest of the industry solves these[[$nbsp]]problems and integrate them into directly the core of future[[$nbsp]]releases.</p>
<h2>Support People Not Users</h2>
<p>There are people and there are users. Any given person can be a number of users throughout the day. Heading to lunch? As you switch from your broadband and keyboard enabled desktop to a mobile phone you are the same person – yet you have become an entirely different user. Can you use keyboard shortcuts? Can you save a file to your desktop? Can you gobble up all the bits you please or is your bandwidth capped by a monthly data allowance? Your abilities are not just relative to your person they are also relative to the devices you access experiences through. Investing time, money, and efforts in the misconception that there are normal people and then there are people with disabilities is ignorant at best. <a href="http://mrmrs.io/writing/2016/03/23/the-veil-of-ignorance/">Accessible software is better for everyone</a>, not just a targeted[[$nbsp]]group.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The final result will be a new Manager Theme you can install in MODX 2.3 or later. A simple change of your Manager Theme setting will enable anyone to use MODX to create and manage sites in an accessible CMS.
&emsp;&mdash;&emsp;<a href="http://a11y.modx.com">a11y.modx.com</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Enable anyone to use MODX? No it won't. What if I'm on a touch device, mobile device, or one of the <a href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2013/10/21/how-many-people-are-missing-out-on-javascript-enhancement/">users that don't receive JavaScript</a> even though it is enabled? What if I can't navigate to the Package Manager to install the opt&ndash;in theme in the first[[$nbsp]]place? You can hack ARIA roles until you are blue in the face but you cannot skip over HTML in your development process and simultaneously support anyone and[[$nbsp]]everyone. <a href="http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/116474-sir-tim-berners-lee-olympic-tweet">The web is for everyone</a> and it was designed to be built atop HTML for this very[[$nbsp]]reason.</p>
<p>The MODX Accessibility Campaign commits to helping particular users of a particular theme &mdash; not people. When you use a device that is keyboard and screen reader enabled the a11y theme is very useful. Otherwise, even though you are the same person, it is no longer as useful. To date, if you are using a small viewport the a11y theme isn't navigable at all. The MODX 2.5 prerelease however is much <a href="https://github.com/modxcms/revolution/pull/12776">improved in this area</a>. To whom does this separation[[$nbsp]]serve?</p>
<p><a href="http://alistapart.com/article/reframing-accessibility-for-the-web">Web accessibility means that people can use the web</a> &mdash; not particular users. We must learn from Wordpress and <strong>put the notion that assistive technology is only applicable to a particular group to rest</strong>. Let us adopt <a href="https://github.com/jpdevries/webguidelines#preface">guidelines that do just that</a>. Let us work towards a web all people can author with MODX regardless of where MODX LLC directs their internal[[$nbsp]]efforts.</p>
<h2>Stop Segregating People</h2>
<p>Let's look at the call for action found at <a href="http://a11y.modx.com">a11y.modx.com</a> which links to <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/reframing-accessibility-for-the-web">this post</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s time to act now and right that wrong! Making an accessible MODX CMS Manager is the right thing—<a href="http://alistapart.com/article/reframing-accessibility-for-the-web">for everybody</a>, but we need your help to complete this huge task.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ok. Cool. Let's look at the definition of[[$nbsp]]everybody:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every person; everyone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Only certain people will install an opt&ndash;in theme that does not ship with the core product.
To claim that an opt&ndash;in theme will support <em>everybody</em> is literally nonsense. The only way to support everybody is to start with HTML and bake accessibility into your product. No exceptions. <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/reframing-accessibility-for-the-web#section1">Anything else is prejudicial[[$nbsp]]segregation</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When we hold a prejudicial view toward a group we are not members of, we tend to see “them” as more alike than the groups we are in. In other words, we see the groups that “we” belong to as full of diverse individuals, but “they” are all alike. This is called out-group homogeneity.<br />
&emsp;&mdash;&emsp;<a href="http://alistapart.com/article/reframing-accessibility-for-the-web">A List Apart</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Group Meetings</h2>
<p>Wordpress contributors join one or more of the following groups that meet on a weekly[[$nbsp]]basis:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/">Core</a></li>
<li><a href="http://make.wordpress.org/design/">Design</a></li>
<li><a href="http://make.wordpress.org/mobile/">Mobile</a></li>
<li><a href="http://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/">Accessibility</a></li>
<li><a href="http://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/">Polygots</a></li>
<li><a href="http://make.wordpress.org/support/">Support</a></li>
<li><a href="http://make.wordpress.org/themes/">Themes</a></li>
<li><a href="http://make.wordpress.org/docs/">Documentation</a></li>
<li><a href="http://make.wordpress.org/community/">Community</a></li>
<li><a href="http://make.wordpress.org/plugins/">Plugins</a></li>
<li><a href="http://make.wordpress.org/training/">Training</a></li>
<li><a href="http://make.wordpress.org/meta/">Meta</a></li>
<li><a href="http://make.wordpress.org/tv/">TV</a></li>
<li><a href="http://make.wordpress.org/flow/">Flow</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In some respects the MODX project already does this. We have a variety of Slack channels that community members can join to follow or discuss particular topics. We have RTFM which anyone can request privileges to edit. Twitter, Slack, and the Forums cover community driven support. There are a number of community initiatives and web sites dedicated to MODX training, plugins, and even[[$nbsp]]themes.</p>
<p>One area we are lacking is the weekly meetings and the resources that surround[[$nbsp]]them. Should MODX move towards a model of open governance perhaps groups that meet periodically would be of[[$nbsp]]benefit.</p>
<h2>[MODX] Next Please</h2>
<p>The MODX 2.x Dashboard was not designed to be inclusive. You'll hear no argument from me that it should have been either. <a href="https://modx.today/posts/2015/06/breaking-modx-for-everyone">Let me explain</a>. When I first discovered MODX 2.0.8 I assumed it was software lead by a team of dozens of developers who focused full&ndash;time on the product. That is not and never has been the case. To this day, MODX 2.x leads the industry in the areas it has focused on. It is nothing sort of spectacular. Jason Coward and Shaun McCormick, along with a small group of contributors, managed to create something truly brilliant with a fraction of the resources necessary to do[[$nbsp]]so.</p>
<p>By any reasonable measure MODX Revolution should be considered a complete success. But I'm sick of being reasonable. Aren't you? It is time we face another defining challenge. Let us enable anyone to author the web with MODX. Let us reimagine the Manager interface from the ground up. Let us commit clearly and concisely that in a future major version (MODX Next) the core must commit to respecting the WCAG Guidelines. No exceptions. Let us join Wordpress in the commitment to make authoring the web inclusive for[[$nbsp]]everyone. Let us do so directly in future updates to our software rather than indirectly in stale releases. Let us learn from[[$nbsp]]Wordpress.</p>
<h2>Keep Your Word</h2>
<p>The MODX Accessibility campaign pledged that updates would appear at <a href="http://a11y.modx.com">a11y.modx.com</a>, the blog, as well in the email newsletter. Let's look at the first update published February[[$nbsp]]24,[[$nbsp]]2015.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We launched our <a href="https://a11y.modx.com/">fundraising campaign to make the MODX Revolution Manager accessible</a> just over a week ago. Since then, we’ve had a wonderful response, with generous donors from around the world. To date we’ve raised a $29,648 including the $25,000 from The Ohio State University—just shy of 60% of our goal! The other comes from:<br />
<br>76 awesome MODX Community members
Each contributing an average of $57
Three individuals generously gave $500
Eight others showed a big thumbs-up with $100
43% of supporters have made contributions of $25</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The update covers the launch of the campaign, how many people donated, and how much had been raised. And that's it. There has yet to be another update. The campaign has raised $12,180 since publishing the first and only update. Prior to MODXpo 2015 I formally requested another update be made. Apparently they haven't gotten around to it yet. MODX LLC &mdash; If you are going to make a commitment to keep paying contributors informed &mdash; keep them[[$nbsp]]informed. At least hold yourself liable to your own commitments. Judging by the three channels expected to be kept up to date one is left to assume that since February of last year no progress has been made. I'm not going to point out how we could learn from Wordpress here because we don't need to. This is simply a case of poor[[$nbsp]]communication.</p>
<h2>Establish a Code of Conduct</h2>
<p>As a passionate and outspoken community member you might think I'd be opposed to establishing a strict code of conduct. That is not the case. I believe MODX needs a Code of Conduct and it should apply to everyone. <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer-handbook/planning-details/code-of-conduct/">Wordpress has a Code of Conduct</a> that we could all learn from. Inclusiveness isn't just about assistive technology that allows anyone to use and author the web. We also need to work towards ensuring the MODX project is a safe place for anyone to[[$nbsp]]contribute.</p>
<p>Over the past 5 years I have worn several hats. I've gone from a MODX site builder, to a contributor, to contracting for the LLC, to being involved with mod<strong>more</strong>, to working full&ndash;time for MODX LLC and back again. I've had the opportunity to view this thing we love from a number of vantage points. I've experienced comradery and productive team work. I've been a part of creating amazing[[$nbsp]]things.</p>
<p>I've also been blatantly lied to, stolen from, and had significant efforts mocked and belittled behind closed doors without any sort of rational justification or constructive criticism. I've listened to contributors character &ndash; not their work &ndash; belittled behind their backs for nothing other than pouring their themselves into the project.
