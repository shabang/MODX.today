<h2>Minimum PHP version increased to 5.3</h2>

<p>Occasionally a hot topic, but in 2.4.0 the minimum required PHP version has been increased. Previously this was 5.1.2 (which, by the way, has been EOL since 2006), however with 2.4 the minimum is increased to 5.3.3. This is still a pretty old version that has also reached its end of life a year ago so you shouldn't depend on that version, but it's a good new baseline requirement.&nbsp;</p><p>If you are still on an older version of PHP, you will see a warning on the dashboard widget, though most of MODX 2.4 will continue to work as expected. 5.3 is mostly required due to changes in package management, which was largely refactored under the hood, so you see issues there.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Dashboard Improvements</h2>

<p>The dashboard received various improvements in 2.4, including a restyled configuration widget with several new checks. These new checks include making sure if your core directory is properly locked down, and if you're running at least PHP 5.3 or up.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another improvement to the dashboard, is that the site name and MODX version are now back in the header after being missing in 2.3. The uberbar is still a single click away as it now expands that below the search icon (and automatically puts the focus on the search field). This change will be very welcome to those that manage more than one MODX site.&nbsp;</p>
