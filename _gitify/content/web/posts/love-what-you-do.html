<p>The Living with Love GoFundMe campaign assists Travis with some new technology which enables him to continue excise his digital creativity and stay in touch with his doctors. I found myself wondering what will this room be like for Travis? What will he put on his walls? Reflecting on when I first discovered MODX and conversations Travis and I about fan art concepts, I had an idea. We'll make a poster.</p>

<p>The MODX Community is vast and diverse, but we all share at least one thing in common. We all love what we do. Through his graphics, art, and creativity, Travis remains a continuous source of inspiration and optimism for the MODX Open Source project. And we need that. Open Source is tough.
