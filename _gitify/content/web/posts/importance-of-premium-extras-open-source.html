<h2>Obvious things first</h2>

<p>Obviously, by charging users to use a product, it helps the developer(s) behind that product to continue developing&nbsp;and innovating. At modmore we found it to be a sustainable business model even in a community the size of ours (which is quite small compared to, say, WordPress), which is a great way to make sure products continue to work and to get better over time. From the developers' perspective, that is great news, but something being open source does not necessarily mean it wont be maintained or improved either.</p><p>For the user, the biggest benefit is likely to be having access to a support email or forum for help. Many developers in the open source world take pride in their work and do the&nbsp;best they can whenever they get a question, but if they are involved in a large number of projects or simply moved on, that can be hard to keep up with. With Premium Extras, users get the advantage of knowing exactly what to expect, for example both modmore and extras.io offer a year of email&nbsp;support, whereas SimpleCart has a stricter limit of how much time is available for support per license.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>What about the larger community?</h2>

<p>By having commercial offerings&nbsp;available, people who look into MODX for the first time will know for a fact that there are multiple&nbsp;people with a vested interest in the future of the project. One thing people often cite about what makes WordPress tick, is the vast library of both free and commercial add-ons, themes and services that are available to them. Now we're getting more and more of that for MODX as well.&nbsp;</p><p>Commercial vendors also tend to be able of doing more complex work compared to open source projects.
